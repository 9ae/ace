# Plan

## Character Profiles

### Define major characters

Define which characters will go through a change arc

Which characters will have a hit point moment

These will be your major characters

### Define minor characters

Can focus more on outward presentation than inner turmoid. But you should know what also drives them.

## World Building & Themes

What are overarching ideas you want to explore, question, and have a pay off answer (or lead to further questioning here)?

Mash together multiple ideas

## Character Arcs

Plot out the change arcs of major characters

Figure out what ideas from the original idea you want to keep here, and what you want to discard

How do their arcs align with the theme you want to explore in this story

## Weave the arcs together 

align them to 9-point story

## Summarize each chapter

- [ ] Have a single paragraph summary of each chapter.

### Scene cards

Now align the chapter outline to a 9-point outline

Write down scenes (they can be more than 9) into scene cards

Figure out which scenes:

- more than 3/4 written (you need dialog and description edits)
- more than 1/2 written (will involve a scene edit)
- needs an entire re-write

# Ideas

- Make the ch1 mission protect the Harts
- The Org starts of as a private security firm hired by the gov, since their detective department budget was severly cut.
- It is during ch2 that Edgar & Jacques has a falling out, and Jacques removes the org from gov employment and allies them with the Order.
