World building notes

Start the story by exploring the pitfalls of the bipartisan system.

**Org does not join the war until Viva takes control.**

Vive and Les  were groomed to take over their family’s business when they grew up.  As result they were pitted against each other, and the two never got along. Vive is not sure did she truly hate Les or  she was manipulated into it.

When she found out Lesa died, she felt cheated out of her final fight with Les, the one where she was going to claim as the rightful heir to her family’s legacy.

When Vive takes over the org, to use their resources to enter the war. It feels like a fated moment, that her destiny had always been to lead a crime organization, even if it’s not the one she grew up thinking she will be heading.

Wow this makes Vive, kind off a terrible person. Spiteful, blind sighted, and entitled. What are the softer sides to Vive?
She cares a lot about protecting Sici.  She is power hungry, but kind. **She does not believe in being a bystander, she will go out of the way to protect strangers.   That is how she and Zaki first met.**

If Ace leads the org, and Yule becomes the highest general of the Church, who leads the gov? … Chelsea… will she live to hide her relationship with Helga? Or will Helga be hiding it from the rest of the org?

gov ~ corrupted by greed, ruled by an privleged class.
church ~ use disenfranchised people to gain power
