Is the gov a collection of good hearted people who, have power but uses it ineffectively?

Can we think of the church and gov as protagonist and antagonist?
How they balance each other out.

Who is the leader, what are their motivations.
This the gov like a 10th generation monarch?
With power handed down to them, without understanding the hardwork and responsibility associated with leadership?

What if the current president (Edgar) and the org leader (Jacques) used to be best friends?
Why did they have a falling out, is it idealogical or personal?
Personal, they used difference of views to draw that divide, but it's just an excuse.

Edgar and Jacques went to boarding school together. Edgar is from a legacy family, his grandfather was big in parliament. Jacques' family are famous musicans who travel a lot. Edgar was a quiet child, who mostly spent time in the library. Jacques was popular with the boys, he played multiple sports, and had a large group of friends. One day, Jacques got in a injury and Edgar helped him. They soon became inseperable; however at the very core both Edgar and Jacques cared too much about what others thought of him. And even though him and Edgar had started to develop feelings for eachother, they ended the friendship.

Jacques knew that he will always be unfit to be with Edgar because this parents came from new money. They had no legacy. Edgar crushed under the weight of his family's expectations, knew he would never have the choice on who to marry.

Knowing they can never happen, Jacques took a sharp turn and descended into the ranks of the underworld.

Edgar is a people pleaser, and is constantly seeking the approval of his family. Because of that, he is kind of like a puppet president.

The Ixan is a city where multiple rivers in Galei and surrounding countries meet.

The main product of Galei is weapons. Galeian weapons are the highest quality, and in a flashback scene Vio receives a dagger made of Galeian steel. Galei was a supplier to Atonian families for the past 1.5 century. In Atonia there is a mythic view of Galei as a utopian place with a thriving industry and peace. Which is why when Lessa and Sici fled servitude they escaped into Galei. 

When all of Atonia came under the order of the church, (~6 years before the start of the story), Galei's economy suffered by losing a huge chunk of its client base. At the time of the story starts, Ivonne is the only territory that is still profitable, because their main industry is musical instruments, due to them having a large forest. 

With much less production in the territories, Ixan's businesses centered around shipping and the trade town also came under. This is the reason why there's so many abandoned warehouses in Ixan. 

With shrinking revenue from taxes, Galei's government became broke and sold many properties (both land and agencies) to private companies. These private companies went from being manufactors to landlords. Many people who have lost their job due to massive layoffs, were unable to be re-trained because education (for both children and adults), used to be a publicly available service has gone private. And they couldn't afford to retrain themselves.

Now most publicly elected officials are under the control of private company's interest. 

Territories also gained more independence as they can no longer count on central government aid. The "invasion" of the church into the other territories was actually a coup to start the war, so the weapons manufactories can have a reason to produce more again. This is also why they set out to invade Ivonne, because the church won't be able to have country over territories with military power. Maybe it can just be Ivonne that got invaded at first, considering they are the only profitable region, central gov has plenty motivation to be upset about it.
