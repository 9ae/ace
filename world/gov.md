Is the gov a collection of good hearted people who, have power but uses it ineffectively?

Can we think of the church and gov as protagonist and antagonist?
How they balance eachsother out.

Who is the leader, what are their motivations.
This the gov like a 10th generation monarch?
With power handed down to them, without understanding the hardwork and responsibility associated with leadership?
