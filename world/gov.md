Is the gov a collection of good hearted people who, have power but uses it ineffectively?

Can we think of the church and gov as protagonist and antagonist?
How they balance each other out.

Who is the leader, what are their motivations.
This the gov like a 10th generation monarch?
With power handed down to them, without understanding the hardwork and responsibility associated with leadership?

What if the current president (Edgar) and the org leader (Jacques) used to be best friends?
Why did they have a falling out, is it idealogical or personal?
Personal, they used difference of views to draw that divide, but it's just an excuse.

Edgar and Jacques went to boarding school together. Edgar is from a legacy family, his grandfather was big in parliament. Jacques' family are famous musicans who travel a lot. Edgar was a quiet child, who mostly spent time in the library. Jacques was popular with the boys, he played multiple sports, and had a large group of friends. One day, Jacques got in a injury and Edgar helped him. They soon became inseperable; however at the very core both Edgar and Jacques cared too much about what others thought of him. And even though him and Edgar had started to develop feelings for eachother, they ended the friendship.

Jacques knew that he will always be unfit to be with Edgar because this parents came from new money. They had no legacy. Edgar crushed under the weight of his family's expectations, knew he would never have the choice on who to marry.

Knowing they can never happen, Jacques took a sharp turn and descended into the ranks of the underworld.

Edgar is a people pleaser, and is constantly seeking the approval of his family. Because of that, he is kind of like a puppet president.
