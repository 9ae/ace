# Core Beliefs

All the planets have souls, and during a contest each planet showed what it could do. Mars spurrted volcanos, Venus made everyone cought with toxic gas, Earth ripped a part of its soul and created the first creature (a sea creature). All the other planets were jealous, and cursed earth. The curse stated that all it's creatures must be willing to rejoin with the earth, before its soul can mend together again. 

## Where do we come from?

We were all original part of a cosmic energy, which we call Nature. Due to the curse, parts of Nature are being ripped apart and held prisons in temporary cells call bodies. Our souls are the fragments of Nature. Nature itself is Earth's soul. 

## What is our purpose in life?

U/N originally. Lygeia provides an answer, and that is to alleviate the suffering of oneself and others, so we may all rejoin with Nature after Death.

## What happens to us after we die?

When we die, our souls should be able to rejoin nature. To ensure a smooth transition, we just let go of our lives (ie: our suffering, grief, and wills). Those who cannot let go, will not be able to rejoin with Nature.

# History

This origin story is believed by people from the peninsula for a centurires. For a long time, many scholars of the religion had a sense of detachment.

One man: Encouraged people to seek their own truths to re-connect with nature. And said what I find true for me is true for all humans. 

Lygeia: transformed the entire religion by making it more worldly and argued that we cannot transition if we don't try to leave the world a better place.  If the earth is the greater body, then we are fragments of nature. **If we cannot join with nature upon death, then nature itself will start to suffer.** Generations and generations pass, with not enough people being able to re-join with nature, the earth will suffer and become chaotic in uninhabitable. Lygeia's major change into spreading the word is this awareness, she wasn't just a social worker. She was also a thought conquistador. **She wanted to convert or strengthens other people's belief, believing we will all be doomed if we don't.** 

After the death, her son Roderik took over and started a militia. He had a twin sister Madelaine, where is she? Now the leader of the church is Roderik, as part of this quest as his crusaders conquers the countries to look for his sister,  Madelaine.

Throughout the life time she was just a normal preacher, but after her death. People started to believe that the spirit if Lygeia would come to you and take over your body at moments near death in order to guide your away through to rejoin with Nature. After the death her children took over her sect.

During one ”spiritual take over” the dying body prophesied that there will be no peace until all people become followers of the sect. (Roderick had actually paid her to fake it). 

Because Roderick identified that is is difficult to let go, if you are stricken with suffering. He identified that the desire to justice, for revenge in a war torn world, pollutes the soul. In the years before the church started taking over the lands, there was alot of wars. Between nations, and even within city-states. Atonia was one of those places that lacked central government. Leadership were at the hands of local powerful families. When Roderick tried to establish more power in Atonia, it pitted warlords against eachother.

In a noble attempt to bring peace to the land, they end up conquering and causing more destruction.

# Sects ( practices)

For a long time, the only practices were those around dying. And that's only if you knew you were dying, or past a certain age. 

Lygeia and Roderick both tried to make more solid rites. Lygeia built places of worship, in which people can come into medidate, but also get food and resources that their families needed.

Confession practice in Lygeian is about a practice of letting go. The listener is suppose to suggest means offering one relief from the pain they have suffered or caused.

It's ruled by a small council of 5, with many regional rulers who report to the council

What are the core beliefs of this religion?
self denial: surrender the concept of self and act in the greater good of others
**The body is a prison**

When people die, they get buried to rejoin with the earth. To ensure a smooth integration you must break free from the worldly attachments. This as a basis makes the religion a very detached religion.

What if transcendentalism became religion?

What if plato's duality is made into a religion?

Founding idea of this religion is that we must learn from the essence of nature. 

They worship the prophet Lygeia
While transcendentalism carries a sense of detachment to the material world, action-based transcendentalism takes an evanglical approach. They believe that individual peace can only be possible if they are surrounded by others in peace. Lygeia in many ways was a social worker, she tried to make the existing world a better place, by helping the homeless, negotiating peace treaties. She and her followers believed that it is wrong to turn a blind eye to the sufferings of the world, and that detachment should from your own suffering should not make you apathetic to others suffering. And that one must acknowledge mutual suffering. This is similiar to how the Transcendentalist aligned with abolitionist agenda. That all people are create equal, and oppression of any group of people by others is a crime against nature. 

After the death, her son Roderik took over and started a militia. He had a twin sister Madelaine, where is she? Now the leader of the church is Roderik, as part of this quest as his crusaders conquers the countries to look for his sister,  Madelaine.

Throughout the life time she was just a normal preacher, but after her death. People started to believe that the spirit if Lygeia would come to you and take over your body at moments near death. After the death her children took over her sect. During one ”spiritual take over” the dying body prophesied that there will be no peace until all people become followers of the sect. Her son Roderik was there at that time, and decide to take that to heart. He decide to form his sect into a more organize religion, and start a crusade.

The church instead of ordering their own weapons, uses the tools of the people they invade. Rod built a strong military by incorporating the styles and techniques of different people they conquered. Building a multi ethnic militia, allowing them to deploy a variety of techniques against their enemies. This strategy in attempt to unify lands and people with radical acceptance of anything else that is not religious, allowed them to expand so fast. It also allowed them to have the conquest and span of power, go undetected by Galei. While Galei officials new that the church is expanding its power, because they never became a customer of theirs, they had no idea to what expanse is the scope of their armies.
