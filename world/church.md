What if transcendentalism became religion?

What if plato's duality is made into a religion?

In the years before the church started taking over the lands, there was alot of wars.
Between nations, and even within city-states. Atonia was one of those places that lacked central government.
Leadership were at the hands of local powerful families. When the church tried to establish more power in Atonia, it pitted warlords against eachother.

In a noble attempt to bring peace to the land, they end up conquering and causing more destruction.

Founding idea of this religion is that we must learn from the essence of nature. 

They worship the prophet Lygeia
While transcendentalism carries a sense of detachment to the material world, action-based transcendentalism takes an evanglical approach. They believe that individual peace can only be possible if they are surrounded by others in peace. Lygeia in many ways was a social worker, she tried to make the existing world a better place, by helping the homeless, negotiating peace treaties. She and her followers believed that it is wrong to turn a blind eye to the sufferings of the world, and that detachment should from your own suffering should not make you apathetic to others suffering. And that one must acknowledge mutual suffering. This is similiar to how the Transcendentalist aligned with abolitionist agenda. That all people are create equal, and oppression of any group of people by others is a crime against nature. 

After the death, her son Roderik took over and started a militia. He had a twin sister Madelaine, where is she? Now the leader of the church is Roderik, as part of this quest as his crusaders conquers the countries to look for his sister,  Madelaine.

Throughout the life time she was just a normal preacher, but after her death. People started to believe that the spirit if Lygeia would come to you and take over your body at moments near death. After the death her children took over her sect. During one ”spiritual take over” the dying body prophesied that there will be no peace until all people become followers of the sect. Her son Roderik was there at that time, and decide to take that to heart. He decide to form his sect into a more organize religion, and start a crusade.
