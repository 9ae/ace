First Person POV: to get a better sense of how he should be reacting to Vio going up to him

I walk through the busy streets of Ixan as if a shadow. The dark only exist in the presence of light. That's why they asked me to do this job,  because I am the unseen. Galei is used to ignoring the presence of its Hastuit refugees. We are the weird cousin your mom makes you invite to your birthday party. The one you and your friends do your best to ignore.

Ixan is splintered by a river, back in the prosperous decades shipments would run from the north produced by the factories around the country. Trade ships would carry weapons and explosives out south to other neighboring countries. But over the past decade, as demand for weapons slowed down, and so has the boat traffic. Now the river has nothing but a few boats docked on their piers. Some of the piers are converted into parks. 

I stop at one of the parks, this one has small garden with lilies and orchids. The white lilies fill the air with a brisk medicinal odor. Holding my left hand to an orchid, I rub a little bit of nectar onto my fingers. The twilight breeze has cleared out every droplet of evaporation from the sky; it is a cloudless night. Reaching my pointer finger to the sky, I trace the dots forming the bull constellation. My mother told me that was my constellation. A butterfly lands on my ring finger to get a taste of the nectar. It is a _, rare to find in these parts of the country. They normally live in more moist climates. I wonder what brought it so far, has it also been escaping from a war torn home like so many people in this city. Very carefully, I prick its body with a needle, and the butterfly freezes in place, as its wing is in full span. I catch it with my hand as it falls from my finger. Taking a small box from my shoulder bag, I place the butterfly into it. I leave the park to walk to one of the draw bridges to the east side.

I approached an the artware house. It used to be a tank storage, through the overwhelming scent of turpentine you can still smell a hint of machine grease inside. [This can also be something Ace also notices]
