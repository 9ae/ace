"So this friend of yours, can get us anything data?" Ace asks breathlessly as she and Helga hiked up the hills in the outskirts of Ixan.

"Anything. But I should warn you... he's a bit eccentric." says Helga.

"How so?"

"Well, he ..." Helga gets cut off as a man sprints in between them muttering "I'm late, I'm late, she's gonna kill me".

"He's right there," Helga saids pointing to the main who rudely cut in between them. "Hey, Alan wait up!" she calls out jogging up to catch up with him.

Alan turns around, "Hey Helgirl! What are you doing all the way out here?" He has started to jog backwards as he is talking to them.

"We're here to see you," Helga catches up and they both stop in front of a faded green garage door, but instead of it being attached to a garage, it was just off the side of a high hill.

When Ace finally caught up, the back of her shirt was wet from running uphill felt embarrassed about it, but realize her sweat was nothing compared to Alan's completely soaked through shirt. The collarless short sleeve shirt hung to his skin, and a purple skin tie held his shorts up as if they were a belt.
