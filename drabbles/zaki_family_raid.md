# Zaki’s family gets raided
Zaki watched as his room’s clock struck 23:05, he knew that his parents retired to their rooms at exactly 23:00 every night. On some nights he would make use of this knowledge and sneak off to their study.  He slowly slide from under the covers, and reached between his mattress and bed frame to withdraw a few scraps of parchment and charcoal. 
As he made his way his bedroom door, he crawled on the floor, peering out  through a small crack between the door and the floor. He laid there on the cold bamboo floor, keeping an eye for the flickering of shadows just in case they are still outside in the hallway.

When he senses peaceful  rest has fallen upon his family, he opened the door slowly and creeped slowly into the study,

Their family study was massive, a room which outsized both his parent’s master chambers and his own room.  Every inch of wall space was lined with bookshelves that piled into the ceiling.  His parents were both scholars, granted permission to live in Gali as refugees for their expertise and mathematics and geology.

Zaki lit the lamp on this mother’s desk and started to draw. His parents said drawing was a useless skill, that with the advent of photography there will no longer be a need to capture our visual reality. But what they don’t see is that drawing is not about capturing world, but interpreting  its truths.
