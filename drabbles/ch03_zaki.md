In Ch3: Zaki wants to get closer to Sicili, so we befriends Vio. **Which scenes can we insert him in?** This interaction is also similiar to how Phil suddenly shows up and wants to get to know me. And I'm like who are you weirdo, go away. What do we want to get out of this scene? **How do they interact when they are not all business together**.

Zaki shows up, Vio is very busy. He won't leave her alone. and we have a bit of a push pull dynamic.

Vio: What are you doing here?

Zaki: Your sister saids you aren't working this evening, and I came to make you guys dinner.

Vio: Why?

Zaki: To thank you, for saving my life ^__^

Vio: But you've already returned the favor by talking to the Nunan for me.

Zaki: Talking? I do that every day. You ran into a burning building to get me.

Vio: *sighs* maybe I should have left you there, then you won't be here bugging you.

Zaki: Oh, I'll still be here. As a ghost, haunting you for letting me die.

Vio: Fine, come in.

`Zaki enters the flat, looks around.`

Zaki: Where's your sister?

Vio: She runs an after school program in church. She's probably wanting for a all too busy mom to pick up her kid. `saids darkly, with a distant glaze coming to her eyes`

Zaki: That's very kind of her to wait with them.

Vio: She tries to keep them distacted from watching the people pass by for ever person that turns the corner, wondering if that's their parent. `staring off into the distant past` Counting people is the slowest away to pass time.

Zaki: I wished my parents will appear around the corner one day. But I know they never will.

Vio: `looks at him knowingly` I know the feeling. I don't know if mine are dead or alive. You don't have to if you don't want to, but if you ever want to talk...

`Sicili opens the door!`

Sicili: Hey, sis! That guy you brought home the other day called and he's... `see's Zaki in the dining room and blushes` Oh hi. Thank you for offering to make us dinner, I cook ever meal and boy can it get tiresome. Vio count barely hold a knife without cutting some flesh off `winks at her sister`
