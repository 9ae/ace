Illyria had given birth to her second daughter, a few hour ealier. After resting, she was eager to hold her new child. As she cradled her baby, her older daughter entered into the nursing chamber.

"Mum," Vio saids softly. This was the first chance she got to speak to her mother in months. Labor was the first time Illyria had not been working in years. Illyria smiles at her older daughter, as she walks to her mother's bed side.

Vio peers through the terrycloth bundle, "she's so small ... and pink."

Illyria chuckles, it was the first time Vio recall seeing anything but a stern expression on her mother's face. "You were just as small when you came out. Hmm maybe not as pink."

"What's her name?" Vio ask.

"Sicili, she will pave our way towards peace. Our bridge, our little dove," Illyria says.

"Does that mean you won't have to go away so much anymore? If there's peace between us and the other families?" ask Vio, how she long for her mother to spend more time at home with her. She knows her parents have to go away because of disputes with other families.

"Only if you protect her, keep her safe at all times," says Illyria.

"I'll protect her with every drop of my blood!" Vio promises with the pump of her first.

Illyria reaches out to pat her older daughter's head.
