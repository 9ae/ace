Alan walks home, gets drawn by the song of a violin.
Spots Adolf playing, they make eye contact ~.^
Adolf turns a little, so Alan can see the hankerchief from peaking out of his back pocket.
Alan adjusts his own hankerchief in his coat's breast pocket.

Alan scribbles his address on a bill, that he drops into Adolf's open violin case.
They make eye contact again.

Alan makes it back to his apartment, nervous about what he has done.

The doorbell rings and it's Adolf.

Alan took this opportunity to invite a stranger in, because Ada and YiHan just left for a mission that morning, and will be gone for a few days.

===

As Adolf is about to leave, Alan grabs his hand.

Alan: Will you come back again? ... not for ... not necessarily.
I just want to hear you play, (*motions violin case*) just for me

Adolf: You're still asking for my time, my time I don't give freely. 

Alan: I will play, how much would you charge?

Adolf: Pay me in (*pulls Allan into a kiss*)
