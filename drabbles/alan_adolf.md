As Adolf is about to leave, Alan grabs his hand.

Alan: Will you come back again? ... not for ... not necessarily.
I just want to hear you play, (*motions violin case*) just for me

Adolf: You're still asking for my time, my time I don't give freely. 

Alan: I will play, how much would you charge?

Adolf: Pay me in (*pulls Allan into a kiss*)
