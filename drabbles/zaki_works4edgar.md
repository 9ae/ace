What if Zaki ends up working for Edgar so he can kill him later?

Then it will put him at opposite sides with vivo again.

In ch2 we should get Zaki to help vivo and rein with their case. It will be one short period where they work well together before being thrown in opposite sides again.

Zaki enters a pentagon shaped room, four sides  are glass walls, you can almost see all of Ixan through here. 
Looking out the walls stood a man in a dark grey suit with grey roots and dark brown hair; he stood with his back to Zaki. “Come stand next to me,” not bothering to turn around to greet this guest.

Zaki joined in a few swift and silent strides. He appeared to be looking out at the construction of the cathedral. “You know there’s nothing I can do. Half of my country has turned against me.”

“Prime Minister,” Zaki started. “You sent for me?”

The man, Edgar Stein finally turned to face Zaki. “They say you are the best. Whatever that needs to be done, you will do it discretely and without ___.”

“Yes sir, what do you want to be done?” Inquired Zaki.

“I would require your services for a while. And all of it must be done in the mildest manner. If we do not want the church to start a revolution.” Edgar answered. “Revolution are bloody things you know.”

Zaki licked his lips before speaking. “What are the terms of my contract?”

“You will be paid weekly $$$$ for as long as you are employed by me personally. You do not work for the state. You work for me; and no one is to know about it. I am sure the compensation is fair, that you should not have to seek outside contracts. You are not to take hits from other party,” Edgar explained.

The wage was ten times more what Zaki earned, and sometimes he would occasionally skimp meals between work. Steady employment was hard to for a man who spent his later childhood years on the streets picking off shop keepers. As much as he loved freelancing, and the opportunities and information gained from working for one mafia boss one week and the local police the next. A chance like this would be a nice break from the constant hunt. And he knew something Prime Minister Stein didn’t , is that his deal would not be permanent, not if his plan goes accordingly. But meanwhile maybe he can surrender his freedom for a government job, a secret government job. Maybe he can give Sicili and Vivo something nice.

“Give me a few days to think about this” Zaki said even though his decision is made.

“Sunday,” Edgar said firmly. “I will sent for you.”
