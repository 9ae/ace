Ada presses the communication button on her necklace. The gem flashes a light, and the mirror she is looking into clears, she looks hopeful, but the mirror only returns to the same room she is in, except there is no Ada in the reflection, just the room. Through the reflection of the mirror, we see Alan's necklace that they found in the bed side table.

"Alan," she whispers. "Where are you?" Tears swells up in the eyes. "Alan" As her own reflection fades back in, she tries again. Same, only just her bedroom without her own reflection. 

"I know you're there?!" Ada bangs her first on the mirror. "Come out!" She hits the mirror harder. Again and again she calls out for the brother, the other half of the reflection is gone. Now not even her own reflection is visible. She pleadges and bargains with the mirror with such violent force, it shatters upon her fist.

Ace walks in, "Yi Han?" Ada calls. She comes into the apartment room to find all the mirrors of the place shattered on the ground. Ada in the middle of it all, cuts etched in her arms, legs, and face. Blood and tears converging in a stream, as the red hair girl lies there heaving in her mourning gown.
