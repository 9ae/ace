They had been traveling for a few days. Initially they made great strides up the peninsula, but now their pace has lagged, and  they are making their way through the mountain range that guarded Atonia’s norther border. Vivara and Sicili's father was from a noble family in the far east. Far enough where they hoped High Priest Roderick's scheming would not get to them. Over the last few years, her parent’s would whisper in private about their growing worry with the Church's involvement in affairs of the Atonia states. While tension had always existed between the Atonia states,  the High Priest has been stoking the flames in Atonia ~~, ever since his twin sister Madelaine went missing. Vivo wondered how many nations she would flip, and levels of hells she would raise, if Sicili ever disappeared~~. She looked over at her sleeping younger sister curled up in the corner of the carriage. Throughout the journey the girls took turns driving the coach.  Lesbia had always been steady coachmen, which is why Vivara was surprised when the carriage came to a sudden stop.  She poked her head out,  to find the drive seat empty.  

“Lessa!”, Vivara hopped out. Her cousin was unconscious on the ground with a dart in her neck. Their horses panicked and a pack of men descend upon them from the slope above their path. Their crescent shaped knifes gleamed in the moonlight.

While Uncle Ardino had taught Lesbia and Vivara multiple forms of martial arts warding off on seven grown men  is going to be a challenge.  Vivara regretted jumping out of the carriage unarmed.  She should have grabbed her crossbow or Lesbia’s sword. But Sicili is too gentle to be a fighter, and with her cousin unconscious she she must protect whoever is left of her family alone.  She launched at there nearest bandit with a jump kick to his chin. ~~The rest of the fight was a blur.~~

The next thing she remembered was toppling over Lesbia, her stomach wound staining her cousins blonde hair. Maybe it was easier give up, maybe they had been meant to burn with their estate, and Death cased them down, to the treacherous mountains, for it will have its souls. “Lessa, I’ve failed.” Vivara cried. She rested her head against her cousin’s slowly but still beating heart. 

“Ah!!!” one of the bandits had dragged Sicili out of the carriage, but the tresses of her hair. 

“How adorable, innocent,” he muttered.  “How deliciously corruptible,” he said as he tear Sicli’s petticoat. 

Vivara snatched Lesbia’s riding crop and aimed for the bandit, who’ had his knife pointed at Sicili with his  right hand, and was undoing his trousers with left . The tail of the whip circled around his  right wrist, and she tugged. hard. He dropped both his knife and and trousers dropped simultaneously.  

It looked as if he was well prepared to commit terrible actions to a nine year old girl. Vivara sweep up to catch the falling knife. In a double handed grip she lounged her bladed at him. He still held on to the part of him that was no longer part of his body. His blood and screams escaped him like a river breaking through a dam.  His comrades all turned towards Vivara,  she let out a sly smile, as she wiped the blood that had rained on her face. The remaining four bandits who was still alive all fled.

All this commotion had upset the horses, and when Vivara tried to calm them down, Midnight in jumped and knocked her down the ledge of their mountain path.
