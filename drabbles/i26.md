# Zaki tries to get Ace back

Z: When I met your sister, I knew she was the bride I had always wanted.  
A: You called me out here in the cold, to tell me that?! Tell her yourself.  
Z: You forbid me from seeing her  
A: Like bans have ever stopped you  
Z: I didn't call you out to profess my feelings towards Sicili. Yes, she's the woman I've always dreamd of having. But you're the one I never in my wildest dreams ever imagine needing!
A: `turns to him incredulously`
Z: So badly... I need..
A: Shut up `kisses him`
