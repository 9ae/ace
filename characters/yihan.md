# Yi Han

Birthday:

Place of Origin: October 1 (Libra) (20)

Family: a brother who was a officer

Friends: Ada, Alan

He is insecure about this place within the tech team, because he feels like an outsider with the Hart twins.
Part of his seduction of ada was so he can have a place within the team dynamic.

Generally non-confrontational, unless he knows he has the upper hand.

Playing as the reality checker for the sibling's upper class idealism, Yi Han reminds them there's naunce in situations. He sees complexity in situations and multiple sides. He is often the peace maker when Alan and Ada gets into a fight.

He's the one True Neutral character in this series.

## Backstory

Yi Han was there because he had perfect memory. YiHan's older brother was a naval officer. His parents died from the NI and Hanon war, so he doesn't remember them. His other brother joined the Imperial navy after the war, because they had an on base day care that can take care of baby Han.

## Arc

What does he think/feel after losing his position with the gov?

> He was scared from the start. What made him move to Galei? Since he didn't know his parents, and was perfectly happy with hsi brother, he never harboured resentment towards his colonizers. And since all the schools were taken over by NI politicians, he grew up thinkig that NI really are here to help places modernize. So he wasn't a sympathizer towards the Hanon rebels like Ada was; they weren't close in their school days so they never debated over it. He was close with Alan eventually when they got over their rivalry. He didn't want to deal with identity issues, and thought that Galei would be an escape from that. So he followed the Harts.
>
> During his work in Ixan with Ada, he was the most politically involved of the three. Frequently reporting to politicans and befriending them. Because of this most of the team's effort gets attributed to Yihan which makes Alan jealous.
>
> While he is not surprised by what happened, because he sensed that they were going to look for a scapegoat for some of the unsolved mysteries (bomb at housing dept, disappearnce of the president's task force.) Unlike the Harts, he has the most to lose with this job since he doesn't have any other claim to status like they do.
