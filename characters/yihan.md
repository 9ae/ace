# Yi Han

Birthday:

Place of Origin: October 1 (Libra) (20)

Family: a brother who was a officer

Friends: Ada, Alan

He is insecure about this place within the tech team, because he feels like an outsider with the Hart twins.
Part of his seduction of ada was so he can have a place within the team dynamic.

Generally non-confrontational, unless he knows he has the upper hand.

Playing as the reality checker for the sibling's upper class idealism, Yi Han reminds them there's naunce in situations. He sees complexity in situations and multiple sides. He is often the peace maker when Alan and Ada gets into a fight.

He's the one True Neutral character in this series.
