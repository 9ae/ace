## Backstory

What is it that I want to est. with this scene? What is at the core of Helga & Alan's friendship other than they are both queer? How do they are both less scarred than many of the characters. Maybe it's their cheerful and optimistic outlook on life. What is their chat repoire? Alan - Ada is casually mocking, with touches of affection. Alan - Yi Han, Yi Han doubts Alan all the time, and Alan is constantly trying to prove his worth. When Yi Han starts flirting with Ada, they become awkwardly serious. Because Alan doesn't know how to feel about his long time friend getting with his sister. With Helga he is less guarded than he is with Yi Han, but definitely not as openly vulnerable as he is with Ada. 

So we can show him hold back a little when Helga probes too much.

## Arc

Journey: Learning that other people may have different values, and they are just as valid as his.

Story: Delay getting fire from the gov. instead of getting kidnapped, he gets fired and sent to a labor camp. As a result Ada and Yihan quits and join the org.

His arc is mostly in the Madame Juliette chapter, for the most part he is a flat character. Always cheerful and optimistic.
