## Relations

### Adolf
@Adolf likes Alan because he sees into his soul, and responds to the music he makes in a way no one else can. He is inspired that Alan can remain so optimistic and innocent in a time of chaos and corruption 

### Helga
Outside the tech team, Alan and @Helga are good friends. Because Helga is super strong, Alan moves making large gadgets that only she can use.

What is it that I want to est. with this scene? What is at the core of Helga & Alan's friendship other than they are both queer? How do they are both less scarred than many of the characters. Maybe it's their cheerful and optimistic outlook on life. What is their chat repoire? Alan - Ada is casually mocking, with touches of affection. Alan - Yi Han, Yi Han doubts Alan all the time, and Alan is constantly trying to prove his worth. When Yi Han starts flirting with Ada, they become awkwardly serious. Because Alan doesn't know how to feel about his long time friend getting with his sister. With Helga he is less guarded than he is with Yi Han, but definitely not as openly vulnerable as he is with Ada. 

So we can show him hold back a little when Helga probes too much.

### Yihan
Friendly hostile. They always had a competitve relationship when they were in school together. @YiHan knows how to bait Alan into getting angry with him, and Alan falls for it everytime.
