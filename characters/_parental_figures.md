Edgar - Gretchen : burning resentment / manipulation
Edgar - Zaki : burning resentment
(do we really need both arcs? one to show revenge and one lets go)

Jacques - Ace : manipulation
How an autistic person can easily be manipulated and gaslit to be made a weapon.

Roderick - Yule : disullusionment

---

I started this story to explore my own sanity in highschool. I think maybe we want to look the problematic relationships our characters have with authority figures.

We can explore gaslighting, how Jacques manipulates Ace to harnest her powers. When does she fugues and when is she consciously a killer? She's fugued a few times before she's ever joined the org. All her killings becoming a fugue, hurts the narrative of a woman with agency. And to some extent she has agency, I think there needs to be more narratives about bad woman being bad just because.

Her first fugue was when they got raided in the mountains.

When she killed the priest that was calcuated castration.

Maybe she only fugues when she is being threatened, will that complicate the whole having no control over super power thing. Will we need to make it as random to the audience as it does to her? Powers awaken in danger is a common super power trope, and I don't think it actively describes my relationship with my math talent.
