#### Anti Hero

What is the ah-ha moment the anti-hero has more of a conscience than they thought? *Yule had that moment when he refused to use the people in Varin's church as bait in order to escape wit the painting.*

NAIL THEIR INTERNAL CONFLICT!

Not just setup to make bad decision. This is a character who has been making lots of bad decisions throughout their life. And they should have a very good reason to be morally flexible. **Why?**

You make your reader look really hard for something good in this character.

Let them be their own worse enemy.

## Theme

### Revenge

When is taking justice in your own hands justifyable?
- secular: when the legal system fails to protect you
- religious: will neeed something along the concept on karma to assure people, that justice will be served. @world/religion

`TODO understand why people want revenge`


---
## Goals

> Holding on to anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die

*How are they dissastisfied with their life?*
He feels like "living as guest in someone's house". Since leaving home, he's never felt safe and free living in Galei.
Why didn't he try to flee? Maybe he should but he hadn't thought of it yet. 

Or there can be richness in the flashback if he really was ready to leave Galei, but he sees the man.

*What do they think will bring the true happiness?*
They think revenge can make them feel safe and welcomed again. How can we make that thought make sense in Zaki's mind?

Or let's work backwards. 
- *What makes him think being with Sicili will bring him happiness?* He first time he meet her she had finished cooking dinner, and offered him some. It could be a dish his family cooked.
- *How do we tie that back to his desire for revenge* You want revenge because you believe they have wronged in, and want to make those who has done it give you what they initialy denied you.
- *What had the boys denied Zaki of?* A sense of security. So to bring that back around, he sees in Sicili as a sense of home.
- *What if he was ready to give up on the plan, but Sicili's rejection turned his attention back to revenge?* We'll need a scene to show that.

*What definitive step could they take to turn their dream into a reality?*
Kill those people and expose the crime they had committed. He made each of them confess to a tape recorder, when he killed them. 

*How has their fear keep them from taking action already?*
N/A they already took action.

*How do they feel they can accomplish their goal while steering clear of the thing they are most afraid of?*
He believe revenge will make him feel safe, but their deaths still haunt him.

## Reasons

*Motivations*

- Revenge. seekers can be narcasist, feels they have been wronged and plan to seek justice for it. they struggle with emotional regulation.

*Fears*

- *What are his fears pre-murders?* Parents will not let him pursue an art career. **Fear of not having agency over your career path**
- *After running away?* Afraid he may not be able to survive on his own.
- *After being framed?* Afraid of being caught. **Afraid to live in Galei, but has no means of leaving.**
- *Before meeting the poison master?* He had toughen up during the years on the streets. He is no longer afraid of the previous things he's afraid of. Now he has alot of confidence in himself. `This could be a spin-off, how Zaki learned to overcome his fears and survive on the streets.`
- **After living with the poison master?** Was the poison master abusive? No, we've tortured him enough. **He did develop the fear of abandonment** because whenever he messed up the poison master muttered about getting another apprentice. He still holds his fear, even after he's no longer dependent on the poison master. And shows it with the sisters?
- *At the start of the story?* Fear of feeling the grief from living in an unjust world? Fear of being caught?
- Developed during the story?

*What do they value in life?*
a beacon, like Sicili .. but why? does everything draw back to the night his parents got killed?

Maybe behind wanting a beacon, he more so wants something to believe in? But why?

why do people believe? maybe it's like the boundless birds problem, knowing the futility of life is too depressing. That we must construct a lie for ourselves to keep us going. I guess this can be something Vio and Zaki bound over in this chapter. 

What is Zaki conscious of that he wants? What did Phil want in life? To believe he can, that despite living in the shadows for many years. He wants to prove to himself that he can have a normal life, a girl friend, a job, and that it won't be all taken away in the blink of an eye. Which is how he feels about being Hastuit in Galei. He saw his parents try to fit into Galeian society, just when they thought they could become part of the culture of the country it was all suddenly taken away.

*What makes them happy?* Painting


*What gives them hope?* Sicili

*What makes them feel alive?* @vio because they get put into alot of near death situations together. He associates her with that rush. 
Their pattern is rush, rush, peace. Where for two chapters they have exciting adventures together, they have one bonding chapter.

Zaki pulls qualities from Philip and Ryan. What would that look like?

What are the qualities that we draw from Phil? His talent at drawing. His overaching gestures. His idealization...

Thinks like Phil but acts like Ryan. At the core, he thinks and feels very deeply about everything. But he's learned that the world is not hospitable to a boy like him. So he often acts out, often impulsively.
