# Vivara

Vio who never wanted to be the leader was groomed for leadership like Lessa, their family plain for Sici was to marry her off to form a political alliance. Vio while not wanting to deal with the politcs of leadership, never envisioned a life outside her family's business. She would have been happy to help Lessa lead, behind the scenes as a strategist.



Vio is written as a girl with asperbergers syndrome. She does not like being touched, and gets along with animals better than humans. Only knows how to take things at face value, which often leads her to be easily manipulated by others. She does not like verbal confrontataion, and would prefer to "fight rather than talk"
