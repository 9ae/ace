How to write autistic characters with good dialogue?
Entrapta draws us in with her sense of wonder. Despite being jaded what are characteristics if Vio inspires us to believe in a better world? She is constantly giving everyone the benefit of the doubt, despite her solidary nature and fear of people. She secretly earns to be surrounded by people. Anyone that is willing to be part of her life, she is too afraid to lose. 

She actually was very jealous of Sicili who was able to easily make friends. But she was told jealous was inappropriate. So she hid it. The source of all her hidden power is her repressed emotions.
