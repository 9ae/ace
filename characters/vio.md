Catch Phrase
> 

How to write autistic characters with good dialogue?
Entrapta draws us in with her sense of wonder. Despite being jaded what are characteristics if Vio inspires us to believe in a better world? She is constantly giving everyone the benefit of the doubt, despite her solidary nature and fear of people. She secretly yearns to be surrounded by people. Anyone that is willing to be part of her life, she is too afraid to lose.

## Goals

*How are they dissastisfied with their life?*
It doesn't have to even be the reason for the inciting incident. It can come fulfilled in the adventure she winds herself in.
We saw so much of Frankie in the pilot. Since Vio is the protagonist we should see this about her in ch 1.
This can be the root of her need. In this series, her need is to believe in herself and take ownership of her powers. Why doe she need this? Because she can't be an appropriate protector for Sicili if she doesn't take ownership of her strength.

**She is tired of this life, and wonders when they can feel fully safe. **

Her fear is herself, she doesn't trust herself. And she truly believes she's cursed, she also had no words for her autism. She feels alone, and believing she'll bring her loved once misfortune only isolates her more.

Zaki breaks her out of her shell, so does Helga and Ada.


*What do they think will bring the true happiness?*
Other than Sicili what is she living for?
What makes her a big believer in forgiveness? Truly, she can't afford to let anyone go. 
To be exocrised from whatever darkness that lurks inside her. In that way is she like Vanessa Ives... thought she doesn't pursue it because in this series she's still ashamed it. So she doesn't even acknowledge it herself.
**living a peaceful life with Sicili**

*What definitive step could they take to turn their dream into a reality?*
Find out who Lessa's murderer is.
Advocate for illegal residents a path to obtain citizenship.

*How has their fear keep them from taking action already?*
She doesn't know what she will do when she finds them. What if it wasn't a target attack on the family. Will she confront them? Will she take revenge? There is a part of her that does, even though she won't fully admit it. Zaki draw that part out of her. Her fear is herself, she doesn't want to face that she partially wants revenge.

*How do they feel they can accomplish their goal while steering clear of the thing they are most afraid of?* By keeping a low profile.

## People
Answer:
1. How do they see this character?
2. How does this character see them?
3. What archetypes does their role in the story play?
4. What is the progression of this relationship?


### Family

Vio who never wanted to be the leader was groomed for leadership like Lessa, their family plain for Sici was to marry her off to form a political alliance. Vio while not wanting to deal with the politcs of leadership, never envisioned a life outside her family's business. She would have been happy to help Lessa lead, behind the scenes as a strategist.

#### Sicili
She actually was very jealous of Sicili who was able to easily make friends. But she was told jealous was inappropriate. So she hid it (reaction formation). The source of all her hidden power is her repressed emotions. And not because she is evil


### Friends

*Something terrible has happened to everyone of her crushes. So she's afraid to like anyone now.*
Her childhood friend was sacrificed, even though she doesn't remember.
Maybe a fortune teller once hold her that she is a curse to those she loves. She truly believes there is evil inside her. Since since she goes through violent fugue states, she is within reason.

#### Erik
Went missing, she assumed he is dead. 

#### Zaki
What if their arc is yes they have chemistry. But Zaki is pursuing your sister. It's like when your crush likes your best friend instead. That makes Vio a much more active character in this triangle. 
Examples: early seasons Willow.
