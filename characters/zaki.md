Zaki is an indep heist master.

Did the gov or church murder his parents?

If gov, the reason Zaki is in the city. He is motivated by revenge. Makes sense.
They are refugee scholars, who lived in a small town. They got murdered by their neighbors.
The local gov turned a blind eye, because the law only protects citizens.

How does his almost dying play into his character?

He dives in head first, which is a contrast towards hestitant Ace.

Who is he a foil for?

Ace? while he is a mix of MPDB and broody bad boy, how has Ace influence him. She loves whole heartedly. While she may not be his dream girl like Sicili, Ace was the first girl to ever show any interest in him. And even though he never intented to, he shows her a certain degree of vunerability because he doesn't care that much if she will stop liking him. 

Yule? Hero v anti-hero arch type.

Alan? Idealists, where Alan learns to correct from his judgement, Zaki doesn't.



What are the precautions of homeschoolig kids? Is that similar to a cancer survivor?
