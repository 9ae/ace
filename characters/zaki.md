Zaki is an indep heist master.

Did the gov or church murder his parents?

If gov, the reason Zaki is in the city. He is motivated by revenge. Makes sense.
They are refugee scholars, who lived in a small town. They got murdered by their neighbors.
The local gov turned a blind eye, because the law only protects citizens.
