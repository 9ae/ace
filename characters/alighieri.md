Vio who never wanted to be the leader was groomed for leadership like Lessa, their family plain for Sici was to marry her off to form a political alliance. Vio while not wanting to deal with the politcs of leadership, never envisioned a life outside her family's business. She would have been happy to help Lessa lead, behind the scenes as a strategist.
