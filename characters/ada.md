While very similar to Ace, she is the much more social one. If this was a school drama, she would be a Blair Waldorf.

## Backstory

In contrast with Ace, who's protectiveness of Sicili is a manifestation of secretly hating her sister. Ada really does love her brother. But she can occassionally get controlling with every aspect of his life. She didn't like Adolf at first, because she felt her brother deserved to be with someone of their class.
> This didn't come across in the Alan & Adolf chapter

What does Ada feel about the current political climate?
How did she get to Galei? How will her journey here inform how she feels about the crumbling political climate. What happened that drove the hearts here?

The Hart's parents are diplomats, when Ada was 12 and Alan was 10. They got deployed into their colony Chundu.
At that time their kingdom is prosperous and they were not under th threat of the church yet. During that time there was a lot of protests in Chundu, with greater desire for self governance. Police overstepping ther bounds was a common thing in Chundu. Before colonization, people often setup shops along the streets without much trouble. It became part of the culture, but after Chundu became a colony, the police would shut down street vendors.

What did the Harts parents believed in? And how did it shape their parents beliefs?
Despite being from the motherland, their parents believed that colonies should have some form of self governance. They didn't think that colonies should be made offical territories of the motherland, and had the right to vote on empire matters. Chundu was the most profittable colony, out producing the GDP per of many territories in the mother land, therefore movement leaders wanted statehood. Their parents were sent their to negotiate compromise.

They intended for their children to be embedded into Chundu culture. So instead of sending their children to an international school, they sent their children to a private school, where they interacted with local children. It was a school for gifted children, since the siblings did start showing their math skills early on. That was were they met Yihan who is in it because he has perfect recall, so it helped him score 100% on all his subjects.

Ada and Alan at the begining of this story is one of the more pure ideological characters. But does their back story actually support this trait? During their time in Chundu, Ada was politically active with the protestors. It was due to an incident that she got Yihan's older brother killed. Her involvement with the independence movement got her parents in a lot of trouble. After graduation, they shipped the siblings off to Galei after getting them a job with the gov.

Alan was upset because he was just starting to date someone new. Why did Yihan follow them? Ada felt guilty that she killed his brother, and he had no other family in Chundu.

The send off was a huge blow to her ego, while she is not aligned with Galei on principle. She thinks that the government must change for the well being of it's people instead of politicans trying to save their assets.

## Arc

While she too like Alan needs to get over the privileged view of the world, her transformation arc is not about that. Since her arc is a corruption arc, we want to focus on her good qualities, and how tragedy can lead her to lose sight of that.

Journey: Ada believes that her actions matter, that she can fight to make change. She is confident in herself. If she is like Blair Waldorf, what are her insecurities? That she no matter how much effort, will stand in her brother's shadow because he is a boy? 

Until Alan disappears, their time together is spent showing how they are very supportive of each other, and push each other. Rivalry and care. What if we made he reason for his kidnapping be her activism? And she knows it, that if she hadn't been so loud that he would not have been taken. She blames herself.

Feeling helpless in her ability to make a better world without endangering those around her, she turns to a live of hedonism.
