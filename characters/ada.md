# Adeline Hart

Other names: Ada

Birthday: May 11 (Gemini) [23]

Place of Origin: Wickshire

Family: Ada, Nana

Friends:



While very similar to Ace, she is the much more social one. If this was a school drama, she would be a Blair Waldorf.

## Backstory

In contrast with Ace, who's protectiveness of Sicili is a manifestation of secretly hating her sister. Ada really does love her brother. But she can occassionally get controlling with every aspect of his life. She didn't like Adolf at first, because she felt her brother deserved to be with someone of their class.

## Arc

While she too like Alan needs to get over the privileged view of the world, her transformation arc is not about that. Since her arc is a corruption arc, we want to focus on her good qualities, and how tragedy can lead her to lose sight of that.

Journey: Ada believes that her actions matter, that she can fight to make change. She is confident in herself. If she is like Blair Waldorf, what are her insecurities? That she no matter how much effort, will stand in her brother's shadow because he is a boy? 

Until Alan disappears, their time together is spent showing how they are very supportive of each other, and push each other. Rivalry and care. What if we made he reason for his kidnapping be her activism? And she knows it, that if she hadn't been so loud that he would not have been taken. She blames herself.

Feeling helpless in her ability to make a better world without endangering those around her, she turns to a live of hedonism.
