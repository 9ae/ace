While very similar to Ace, she is the much more social one. If this was a school drama, she would be a Blair Waldorf.

## Backstory

In contrast with Ace, who's protectiveness of Sicili is a manifestation of secretly hating her sister. Ada really does love her brother. But she can occassionally get controlling with every aspect of his life. She didn't like Adolf at first, because she felt her brother deserved to be with someone of their class.
