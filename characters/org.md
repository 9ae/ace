##Helga

Trans-girl, hella strong, blonde, friends with Alan, they met when Helga thought she was a gay man. She use to be a gov agent, named Arend. She works for the org because it gives her means to go through her transition, and is one of the few places that will employ her. "Be someone's pretend lover or be a killer"

JOURNEY: address the insecurities about finding people who like her despite her body. And also those who fetishize her. Her relationship with Gretchen was the first one since her full transition, with Gretchen so quick to leave her it starts the question.
