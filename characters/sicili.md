*What is the worst thing that happend in their life?*
During their early years, she and Lessa had to depend on the kindness of others to house and feed them for survival. Until Lessa was able to provide them stable income (at 16), for 2.5 years they moved from relatives and family friends. This was when she was only 8 years old. This made her eager to please people. She sought out to live up to the ideal of whoever her guardians think a daughter should be.

## Reasons

*Motivations*
Sicili is more into pleasing a larger general audience than Yule is. But in how much of their sense of self is based of how much people like them, they are relatable to eachother in that way. They understand eachother deeply, because they were raised in communal upbringings whereas Ace and Zaki had more solidatrary years.

*Fears*
Ace had trouble connecting to people at a young age. Since their parents were rarely around, Sicili had thought that love with conditional. That only if she did X and didn't do Y, then Ace will love her. And even though Ace loves her unconditionally, it was never properly communicated between the sisters. So Sicili did whatever it was to please those around her. In chapter 4 we see Sicili grows out of her shell, as she disagrees with Ace about continuing to work for the church. This is because as she got older, she learned that she has more leverage by being likable by others. 
**People no longer like her. **

*What do they value in life?*


*What makes them happy?*
That she can be seen for the real her, which is why she works a lot better with Yule than with Zaki. Zaki was never able to see the real her, but just the ideal she represents. Her connection with Yule is deeper, because they are able to get into the point of vunerability with eachother. They are willing to accept eachother behind the mask.

*What gives them hope?*
For the people around her to be happy. 

*What makes them feel alive?*

## Battle strategy

*How do they deal with conflict?*
Sicili's strength comes from her ability to mobilize the powers of others. She knows that she is only as strong as the people who believe in her and is willing to throw their lives down for her.


*How do they deal with loss?*


*How do they deal with change?*


*What is their method of manipulation?*
