## Arc

belief: The teachings in the order of lygeia are ultimately good for the world

test: confronted with the astrocities that Roderick has commited under the religion's name. Uncertain if she still can serve in their name.

what's reassures her belief? Yule going against orders after Rod tells him to do something against his own conscience.

What pressure it must be to be a beacon of hope for people? But how did she end up becoming that? Is there more to her than just being naturally likeable?

## Reasons

Motivations

> Sicili is more into pleasing a larger general audience than Yule is. But in how much of their sense of self is based of how much people like them, they are relatable to eachother in that way. They understand eachother deeply, because they were raised in communal upbringings whereas Ace and Zaki had more solidatrary years.
> Sicili's strength comes from her ability to mobilize the powers of others. She knows that she is only as strong as the people who believe in her and is willing to throw their lives down for her.

Fears

> Ace had trouble connecting to people at a young age. Since their parents were rarely around, Sicili had thought that love with conditional. That only if she did X and didn't do Y, then Ace will love her. And even though Ace loves her unconditionally, it was never properly communicated between the sisters. So Sicili did whatever it was to please those around her. In chapter 4 we see Sicili grows out of her shell, as she disagrees with Ace about continuing to work for the church. This is because as she got older, she learned that she has more leverage by being likable by others. 
>
> People no longer like her. 

What makes them happy?

> That she can be seen for the real her, which is why she works a lot better with Yule than with Zaki. Zaki was never able to see the real her, but just the ideal she represents. Her connection with Yule is deeper, because they are able to get into the point of vunerability with eachother. They are willing to accept eachother behind the mask.
