## Backstory

Yule tells Ace about how they threaten his family’s village and forced them to convert.
He was the chief’s son, and was kept as hostage to make sure that their clan allied with the church.
The church took him and a few other children, who’s parents were burnt as heretics. Erik was one of them.

Since the org and the church are initally working together, what if Ace and Yule actually don't know eachother, and this first series is when they develop a bound. The people who found Ace were Erik's tribe, they took her in and trained her how to kill properly. They were her family for a few years, until the Church raided them, and forced them to convert. Erik and Yule were brothers, Yule converted and Erik and Ace refused and they look them away to be tortured until they convert. They look Ace away to be raped by a bishop, but of course she killed him. When she returns to their cell to rescue he was gone. She couldn't find him anywhere, and she finally escaped.

Ace's history is one of perpetual displacement and seperation from the people she cares about. When Ace and Yule meets again in chapter 3, she personally hates him for converting.

Yule is a noble heroic character subverted. While he wants to live by a good moral code, he betrays his tribe because he believes that unity will be for the greater good. Unlike most hero-types he is not single sighted and blind, the complexity of his character lies in him being able to make compromises.
