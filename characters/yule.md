# Yule

Other names: Jyri

Birthday: Jan 10

Place of Origin: The Falcon tribe of the Mountains

Family: Erik

Friends: Ace, 

Yule (and Ada) pull qualities from Guy, Chase, Jesse, Alex B

The mountain people speak in short direct sentences (kinda like Yoda if he just said the first half of his sentences). But he changed his speech pattern after time with the Order, although he sometimes still slips back in mountain speak, when he is angry or loses patience.

## Backstory

Yule tells Ace about how they threaten his family’s village and forced them to convert.
He was the chief’s son, and was kept as hostage to make sure that their clan allied with the church.
The church took him and a few other children, who’s parents were burnt as heretics. Erik was one of them.

Since the org and the church are initally working together, what if Ace and Yule actually don't know eachother, and this first series is when they develop a bound. The people who found Ace were Erik's tribe, they took her in and trained her how to kill properly. They were her family for a few years, until the Church raided them, and forced them to convert. Erik and Yule were brothers, Yule converted and Erik and Ace refused and they look them away to be tortured until they convert. They look Ace away to be raped by a bishop, but of course she killed him. When she returns to their cell to rescue he was gone. She couldn't find him anywhere, and she finally escaped.

Ace's history is one of perpetual displacement and seperation from the people she cares about. When Ace and Yule meets again in chapter 3, she personally hates him for converting.

Yule is a noble heroic character subverted. While he wants to live by a good moral code, he betrays his tribe because he believes that unity will be for the greater good. Unlike most hero-types he is not single sighted and blind, the complexity of his character lies in him being able to make compromises.



His adoptive mother Benedetta, named Erik after her lost son.

## Arc

Journey: Means matter on the journey towards an end

Story: 

Unlike Zaki who approaches things with rage, Yule is careful planning. What does Yule want? To end all tribal warfare by unification. Because of the Church's success in Atonia and Nuna, he really does believes that people across different cultures can united under one faith. He truly belief that it will be the unifying thread to allow people to have empathy for one another.

## Reasons

Motivations

> Rised to be the a contender for leadership, even though his father is the chief of the tribe. His own leadership is not guarenteed, there is an expectation that he will run as leader when his father passes away. But the mountain tribes do no have inheritence leadership, and it is merit based. In their tribe, when it's time for a new leader. There is a competition, one is fighting, another is listing out deeds of one's life by a unbiased party. Every adult in the tribe casts a vote. 
>
> In that way, both him and Ace are similiar as their were groomed for leadership. The difference is Yule willingly accepted his path, where was Ace didn't want the responsibility. They are both older siblings, and otherstand each other's pressure in that role, of having to make choices for the better well being of others.
>
> This is why he joined in with the Church. He genuinely wants to bring peace to all nations.

Fears

> Letting people down. He it kills him that he had to betray is tribe. But he thinks it's the best way for them to stay alive and protected. Now he see's Roderick as a father figure, and doesn't want to let him down. Even though he is starting to find his orders questionable, for not being in the interest of the people.

What makes them happy?

> Knowing that is loved ones are safe. When people are proud of him? He responds well to words of affirmation. So much of his sense of self is wrapped in becoming a good leader, that all he wants is acknowledgement that he is/had made the right decision. He is someone who cares a lot of what other thinks about him, especially people close to him. 

What gives them hope?

> He hopes to find his brother Erik one day. And he hopes that his sacrifice by working with the church is worth it. Before he meet Sicili he was starting to lose faith in his alligence but he gives him hope because she enspouses the virtues of what Lygeian is suppose to be.
