# Plan

## Character Profiles

### Define major characters

Define which characters will go through a change arc

Which characters will have a hit point moment

These will be your major characters

### Define minor characters

Can focus more on outward presentation than inner turmoid. But you should know what also drives them.

## World Building & Themes

What are overarching ideas you want to explore, question, and have a pay off answer (or lead to further questioning here)?

Mash together multiple ideas

## Character Arcs

Plot out the change arcs of major characters

Figure out what ideas from the original idea you want to keep here, and what you want to discard

How do their arcs align with the theme you want to explore in this story

## Weave the arcs together 

align them to 9-point story

## Summarize each chapter

Slot your chapters with no more than 3 plot threads.
Plot A - opnes and closes arc within chapter
Plot B/ C - can open not necessarily close. Lead into next chapter or close from prev chapters.

Try to just stick to 2 and show how they talk to eachother. Contrast, branch, resonate
- *branching arcs* are when 2 characters are put in a similar situation and they react very differently.
- *contrasting arcs* are when they go in different directions. `ex: fall vs change`. or thwy they both change but have a swap in views.
```
ex: Yule learned he should save more people
Alan learned he should stop saving people, who doens't want it.
They coolide latr with their new beliefs.
```
- *resonating arcs* is when they both achive the same final view. A good use of this is to have psychological and sociological change arcs that are analoguous of eachother. `ex: forgiveness & restorative justice`.


- [ ] Have a single paragraph summary of each chapter.

### Scene cards

Now align the chapter outline to a 9-point outline
- [ ] Dig through [cards dumped here](https://github.com/9ae/ace/milestone/4) convert them to scene cards or archive them

Write down scenes (they can be more than 9) into scene cards

Figure out which scenes:
- more than 3/4 written (you need dialog and description edits)
- more than 1/2 written (will involve a scene edit)
- needs an entire re-write

#### Fight scenes

Think of them as dialog

@vio and @zaki ones are to enhance their physical attraction to eachother by constantly getting into danger together

# Ideas

- Make the ch1 mission protect the Harts
- The Org starts of as a private security firm hired by the gov, since their detective department budget was severly cut.
- It is during ch2 that Edgar & Jacques has a falling out, and Jacques removes the org from gov employment and allies them with the Order.
