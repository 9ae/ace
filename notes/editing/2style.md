# Goals

## Snappy dialog

- [ ] Research how to write snappy dialogue
  - [ ] Cadence
  - [ ] Tricks
- [ ] Create catalogue of dialogue writing techniques



### Fight scenes

Think of action sequences like a conversation, they are talking without words. You can use the same candence techniques to write engaging fight scenes. Maybe instead of describing, just draw stick figures on what should happen.



## Set the scenes (what to show)

- What are the primary color palettes

- Should the reader be feeling throughout this scene
- What are the characters feeling?



# Execution

1. Research
2. Test it out



> For each chapter mark a few key scens that you want to draw out. They should set the tone of the chapter.
