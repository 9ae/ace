@female_rage Can Vio be the primal embodiment of it? 

What about this protagonist resonates with me?


# Themes
How to incoroporate theme into your story?

1. Why does the story matter to you?
forgiveness >> revenge
**macro** (punative vs restorative justice) vs **micro** (forgivness vs revenge)
maybe it's because of edgar's inability to forgive edgar that raises the central conflict. Or it can be a government level, some institution insist of getting even with another institution that leads to the suffering and collapse of Galei. Instead of helping eachother through a rough time they are more interested in getting even, which brings both parties down.

2. Flip it on your head, that will be the lie your protagonist believes in.
Angst against the church, desire to find Lessa's killer.
She never planned to seek revenge, but Zaki feeds into her worst instincts.  

3. What is the origin of acquring the lie?

4. Patterns, how do they learn this again and again?

5. How does your protagonist learn the truth?
