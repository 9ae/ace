What is the structure of the gov?

What type of reli is the church in Ace?
Should we assume it a jc rel?
What if we combine buddist and christianity tenants?

What is the primary tension between gov and church?
The church wants to build an empire across multiple nations as the overseeing power.
And the gov wants to keep itself secular, the church urges governments to declare a national religion.
Gov is doing a very bad job over the past decades, due to corruption, there is famine and unemployment.
