# Lessons Learned from Rise of Skywalker & Sequel Triology

TROS has was too focused on what having things happen. This happens then that happens, it leaves little time for emotional beats to be felt.

Introduced too many new characters when they should have spent more time developing existing characters

Did not prioritize A plots and B plots

Same with character arcs

Pacing is awkward FoA was slow-midpaced. tLJ was slow placed. tRoS was too fast paced

# How can Ace do better?

## Character prioritization

- Protagonist
  - Ace
  - Zaki
  - Alan
- Primary Characters
  - Yule
  - Jacques
  - Roderick
- Secondary Characters
  - Sicili
  - Ada
  - YiHan
  - Edgar
  - Helga
  - Gretchen



## Focus on character arcs first

Then derive the story from those themes
