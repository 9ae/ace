# Lessons Learned from Rise of Skywalker & Sequel Triology

TROS has was too focused on what having things happen. This happens then that happens, it leaves little time for emotional beats to be felt.

Introduced too many new characters when they should have spent more time developing existing characters

Did not prioritize A plots and B plots

Same with character arcs

Pacing is awkward FoA was slow-midpaced. tLJ was slow placed. tRoS was too fast paced

# How can Ace do better?

## Character prioritization

- Protagonist
  - Ace
  - Zaki
  - Alan
- Primary Characters
  - Yule
  - Jacques
  - Roderick
- Secondary Characters
  - Sicili
  - Ada
  - YiHan
  - Edgar
  - Helga
  - Gretchen



## Focus on character arcs first

Then derive the story from those themes.

What are the things that has to happen to take the character on their journey?

### Ace

Journey: Coming into her own power & taking leadership and responsibility of the world she is in

Story: 

	- seeing the people she care about getting caught in larger plots
	- 

### Zaki

Journey: Forgiveness, Letting go of ideas. Letting go

Story: Zaki wants to get close to Edgar to kill him and the rest of the council. 

### Alan

Journey:

Story: Delay getting fire from the gov. instead of getting kidnapped, he gets fired and sent to a labor camp. As a result Ada and Yihan quits and join the org.

### Yule

Journey: Means matter on the journey towards an end

Story: 



### Ace and Zaki

They play off each other. Zaki makes Ace **take action**. Ace helps Zaki **move on**.
