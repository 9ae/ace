# Emerson

Holding diametrically oppositing views a byproduct of the dynamic nature of culture and of the individual. More interested in the process of thinking. Interested in the soul for its ability to act, in its ability to change. 

Emerson IDs the contemporary human pains as we come too late. **We are in the age of memorial, tomb building. Instead of thinking for ourselves.** Believes human mind, can contain contradictions, and may be able to hold and be expanded by contradictions. Unwilling to be tyrannized by the past. "there's not only creative writing, but creative reading." Process of creative reading, contradictions are contained. 

>  Series 1 is about characters learning to let go of the past (authority), and derive meaning for themselves of what it means to live.

`To believe our own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men, -- that is genius. Speak your latent conviction, and it shall be the universal sense; for the inmost in due time becomes the outmost,`- Emerson

> The faulty belief that will come to cause much more suffering is the assumption of "what is true for me is true for all". The evangelical nature of the religion, ends up causing many people more harm than good. It has many great ideas and philosophies but we also want to bring into account of all the pitfalls.

Nature immitates the soul; does not think but do. - Plotinus (neoplato philopsher)

> Our souls are manifestations of nature's soul in fragments. If the earth is the greater body, then we are fragments of nature. If we cannot join with nature upon death, then nature itself will start to suffer. Generations and generations pass, with not enough people being able to re-join with nature, the earth will suffer and become chaotic in uninhabitable. Lygeia's major change into spreading the word is this awareness, she wasn't just a social worker. She was also a thought conquistador. She wanted to convert or strengthens other people's belief, believing we will all be doomed if we don't. Roderick identified that is is difficult to let go, if you are stricken with suffering. He ID that the desire to justice, for revenge in a war torn world, pollutes the soul. 

> Confession practice in Lygeian is about a practice of letting go. The listener is suppose to suggest means offering one relief from the pain they have suffered or caused.

The universe fundamentally good. preference for intuition > material investigation (scientific knowledge). 

Swedenborg doctrine of correspondence. ie: language, nature is a vehile of thought. words re signs of nature facts. 

Emerson wants to promote genres: insight, revelation, poetry. interested in originality instead of retrospect. Poe suspicious of perseptive (unreliable narrator). 

Optimism in self to understand all. Proposes that what is us, isn't what we see in the mirror. Mind unify nature and culture, then separates both from the self. We live in a world we forgot we created. We participate in the creation of ourselves. We must take control over nature ourselves; which makes him an anti-naturalist. He might care more about people than nature.

Society, the social state is the divided state.. we are divided from our true nature. The state of society is nature has been so divided that it cannot be re-combined. Indsutrial specialization has divided us so much we are reduced to gears. Marx looks at how we can create a state that can unify this fragmented state. 

While Emerson distrust organize religion, he is still a Christian at heart. Where Marx sees religion as an illusion. 

Locke - possessive individualism, idea of self from property. who you are is what you own? you are born with your own body. mcPherson (and emerson) thinks that's a terrible way to view oneself.

Emerson - the mass is a mob. first need to disengage, in spiritual isolation, to come to our truth. grassroots self-reliance effort to obtain truth. What we need to do is find the heroic within ourselves. 

Marx - the mass can be powerful if we can work together

Emerson takes Locke's materialism and uses the technique of arguments to re-appropriates for spiritual enlightenment.

Cosmopolitism diversity is a fact, Universalism diversity is a problem.

> many religions in itself is beign and in many ways was constructed as a way to encourage humans to to be kinder to one another. It is formed as a way to dampen ourselfish gene. The irony is that so many religions have been used by individuals then obtain power and act selfishly.

`grief will make us idealist. I grieve that grief can teach me nothing, though carry me one step into nature` - E 

We understand that we don't see directly. 

We can no longer correct our distorting lenses, once we live in what we saw. Cartesian split between subjectivity and objectivity. Transparent eyeball, we are no longer untainted.  Realize what we say when we look at Nature is self. 

Crucible of belief. Ends with optimism. Self-trust.

It's not the necessity of self trust, but there isn't anything you can trust by one self. We have the divine in each of us. 

Wintrop city on a hill (200 years ago), Thoroeau is a though experiment on Walden. Cartesian stripping away, to reform.

Lurking in Emerson is the residue of Puritan ideas. 

Ontological individualism, society but a necessary evil. 

# Thoreau

Huckleberry Finn civil disobedience - poll tax

Poetry happens into jail.. gives him insight of the culture outside of it.

progress to true democracy must acknowledge a higher right of the individual.

A new kind of state he thought of in jail, translate Emerson's thoughts into political theory.

Starts with economy, what would it be like to rethink? Man has no time to be anything but machine.
The cost of a thing is how much life you are willing to give up to get it. 

Walden is a thought experiment. Physically reduce life to its lowest terms. To get to the bottom of things. Search for foundation search for reality. How to get beyond appearance. Asking the right questions, using the scientific method, recognizing when that's not enough.

Is it possible to get outside the system? ODs on contradiction, not comfortable anywhere not in nature or culture. 

Social choices -> individual choices -> Social choices

House is springboard for the imagination. 

Day ~ year. Induction. Talks about man's incursion into nature more than nature. Extrapolates occurances in nature to find a higher truth. There is one set of principles patented in a leaf, nature corrects itself. Interested in the possibility of redemption and perfection. 

Core Trans ~ conflate individual with divine

He knows the cabin will disappear, but Walden as a book continues to exist.

you have to know how to ask the right questions. 

Death is a possibility, he will hit hard bottom but he will be dead by then. Our bodies limit us, we need something more, we need imagination. 

# Whitman

unlike Emerson and Thoreau is much more interested in people, and more atune to one's body. Breaking free from their platonic notion that the body body is a prison.

Develops a larger than life persona, constantly reworking his poetry. Constantly re-inventing himself.

Emerson wanted poetry to not be just metres, but metres making an argument. The poet has a new thought instead of imitation.

Whitman reprinted Emerson's praising letter on the 2nd edition. `It can be like Roderick using Lygeia's influence to conquer the world`

link between procreation and artistic creation

Whitman see new culture in the lives of immigrants. Ahesive, close together in the LES slums. Sees the crucible of democracy in that. Explores common that the new england transcendentalist are too afraid to explore. 

Song to Myself extrapolates personal truths to be universal, celebration of self divinity. different ways one can celebrate oneself. Assume all people are alike. Whitman objectifies himself as an instrument to observe the world. Try to express what is uniquely American, and encapsulate its culture in that poem. 

> How does the Buddhist vein of Transcdentalism get to self celebration?
> Part of becoming one with nature is isolating from society, with the assumption that society is corrupt and we must leave it behind to join with nature. There already is a sense that the only truth you can be sure of is your own truth.
> Lygeia's unwillingness to let other's suffering go brings back a materialist yearning into the Order.
> Combining the self-truth extremity of the faith, with Lygeia's involvement back in the word, Roderick takes it one set further to say his own truth is everyone's truth and will enforce that.

Also willing to include contradiction, Whitman is a cosmopolitan thinker, to embrace the difference. What is the difference between Emerson's universal history and Whitman's sense of history?
