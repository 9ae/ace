Holding diametrically oppositing views a byproduct of the dynamic nature of culture and of the individual. More interested in the process of thinking. Interested in the soul for its ability to act, in its ability to change. 

Emerson IDs tthe contemporary human pains as we come too late. **We are in the age of memorial, tomb building. Instead of thinking for ourselves.** Believes human mind, can contain contradictions, and may be able to hold and be expanded by contradictions. Unwilling to be tyrannized by the past. "there's not only creative writing, but creative reading." Process of creative reading, contradictions are contained. 

>  Series 1 is about characters learning to let go of the past (authority), and derive meaning for themselves of what it means to live.

`To believe our own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men, -- that is genius. Speak your latent conviction, and it shall be the universal sense; for the inmost in due time becomes the outmost,`- Emerson

> The faulty belief that will come to cause much more suffering is the assumption of "what is true for me is true for all". The evangelical nature of the religion, ends up causing many people more harm than good. T has many great ideas and philosophies but we also want to bring into account of all the pitfalls.

Nature immitates the soul; does not think but do. - Plotinus (neoplato philopsher)

> Our souls are manifestations of nature's soul in fragments. If the earth is the greater body, then we are fragments of nature. If we cannot join with nature upon death, then nature itself will start to suffer. Generations and generations pass, with not enough people being able to re-join with nature, the earth will suffer and become chaotic in uninhabitable. Lygeia's major change into spreading the word is this awareness, she wasn't just a social worker. She was also a thought conquistador. She wanted to convert or strengthens other people's belief, believing we will all be doomed if we don't. Roderick identified that is is difficult to let go, if you are stricken with suffering. He ID that the desire to justice, for revenge in a war torn world, pollutes the soul.

> Confession practice in Lygeian is about a practice of letting go. The listener is suppose to suggest means offering one relief from the pain they have suffered or caused.

The universe fundamentally good. preference for intuition > material investigation (scientific knowledge). 

Swedenborg doctrine of correspondence. ie: language, nature is a vehile of thought. words re signs of nature facts. 

Emerson wants to promote genres: insight, revelation, poetry. interested in originality instead of retrospect. Poe suspicious of perseptive (unreliable narrator). 

Optimism in self to understand all. Proposes that what is us, isn't what we see in the mirror. Mind unify nature and culture, then separates both from the self. We live in a world we forgot we created. We participate in the creation of ourselves. We must take control over nature ourselves; which makes him an anti-naturalist. He might care more about people than nature.

Society, the social state is the divided state.. we are divided from our true nature. The state of society is nature has been so divided that it cannot be re-combined. Indsutrial specialization has divided us so much we are reduced to gears. Marx looks at how we can create a state that can unify this fragmented state. 

While Emerson distrust organize religion, he is still a Christian at heart. Where Marx sees religion as an illusion. 

Locke - possessive individualism, idea of self from property. who you are is what you own? you are born with your own body. mcPherson (and emerson) thinks that's a terrible way to view oneself.

Emerson - the mass is a mob. first need to disengage, in spiritual isolation, to come to our truth. grassroots self-reliance effort to obtain truth. What we need to do is find the heroic within ourselves. 

Marx - the mass can be powerful if we can work together

Emerson takes Locke's materialism and uses the technique of arguments to re-appropriates for spiritual enlightenment.

Cosmopolitism diversity is a fact, Universalism diversity is a problem.

> many religions in itself is beign and in many ways was constructed as a way to encourage humans to to be kinder to one another. It is formed as a way to dampen ourselfish gene. The irony is that so many religions have been used by individuals then obtain power and act selfishly.

`grief will make us idealist. I grieve that grief can teach me nothing, though carry me one step into nature` - E 

We understand that we don't see directly.
