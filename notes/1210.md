* If Zaki did not kill Lessa, what is the thing that breaks their relationship in the end?
  * Would it make sense for it to be something more organic?
    * they were using eachother
    * there personalities are incompatible
  * if their dynamic is suppose to be modeled after the fling I had with Ryan, what broke Ace and Zaki up?
    * dishonesty
    * having to make choices with career
    * not ready for a relationship
    * betraying/hiding yourself to have someone like you
    * **seeing an end before it begins**
* What to do with Jacque and Edgar?
  * They have a whole backstory, but will that play out. What to show and what to grow?
    * 
  * Is their relationship analogous to others?
    * Jacque is like Zaki, in that he helped Edgar (~ Ace) grow out of their shell. While Jacques ends up earthshaking changes in response to not being able to be with Edgar, which is more similar to a thing Ace & Zaki does.
