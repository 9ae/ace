Ace does not want to ally with the church. 

Alan is afraid that the government will fire him if they find out he is gay, and goes through lengths to hid it from his friends and sister

Chelsea knows that going into civil war with the church will destory Ixan, and she does not want to see the country her mother worked so hard to keep peaceful go into ruin. (Plus now that the org is allied with the church, she and Helga will be on opposite sides of the conflict)

Yule starts to see cracks in the vision of peace, that Roderick insist he is trying to bring by conquest.



Characters to develop? Yule and Roderick

How can we uses Adolf's knowledge of gov and church officials to push the plot?
There is no resolution to the conflict introduced.

Maybe terms of employment is just a theme in this chapter as opposed to the main plot point in this chapter. What is the actual plot? Or rather what is the story of this chapter?

What do we do about when an unexpected power takes over?
Where do your alliance lies? What factors decide?

Major authority dynamics
Vio - Jacque: transactional
**How does Vio deal with her boss wanting to align their organization with the institution that has caused her family(birth/adoptive) so much pain in her early childhood. The Church that has displaced her over and over again. ~ emotion beat**

Chelsea - Edgar: spite
How does Chelsea deal with Edgar, the man who got her family exhiled? Balancing her need for the good of the nation v her own personal needs. What is their dynamic? Where Chelsea is composed and aloft, Edgar is easy to anger and takes offense easily. He is a man who moves large pieces over a small cause. Even though he has external reasons, "You moved against my citizens", it's more about the fact that Rod fired without consulting him first.

Yule - Roderick: mentor, disillusionment
Probably the most complex of them all, because Yule went in knowing that Rod has harmed his loved ones. Should be the major plot thread of this chapter.



- (fb single page) to when a church campaign invaded Yule's tribe taking Vio and Erik away
- Rod comes by, and nurse bows out. Rod comments on how he did a good job handling the situation. And ask who is Vio (fyi Rod was not there during the invasion of Yule's tribe.)
- Rod comments on how she does not look like someone from the tribes.
- Yule ask how do they plan to get the people to stand by the Church if they had started off the relationship so hostile to the citizens. That long gone are the days of using intimidation and might to take over, especially in large nations as opposed to separate tribe, that even with 2 full nations under their control. They don't have what it takes to go into a full out war.
- Rod comments on how there leader is weak and easily manipulated, he plains to walk Edgar into committing more violence against their citizens, so the events of the cathedral's opening pale in comparision. "Com'on we have to meet our new allies"

- Cuts to scene with Chelsea and Edgar

- Rod & Yule meet with Jacque (Rein & Helga by his side as body guards), Vio follows along in the back. Yule and Vio keep on looking at eachother through the meeting.

- After the meeting Vio and Yule finally talk in private. Yule asks about Erik.
- Vio tells the story of how she and Erik got separated.
- Angst about all the terrible things the Church has done to people she loved, and can't believe that she now has to work for them.
  Yule: well would you rather work for the government?
  Vio: Why do I have to choose sides, if I am not with you, doesn't mean I am against you.

- Zaki gets hired by Edgar to keep a watch on people of the org

Minor power dynamics
Adolf - Alan : transactional by default, but can get murky.



With everyone upset at their boss, how does this conflict gets resolved?

Who leaves and who stays to work things out.

Chelsea or Yule leaving would be OOC. 

Ace is the only logical choice. What if she temporarily leaves the org to work with Zaki?



Well what are the conditions that might make Chelsea leave? Will Helga follow her?

It can be a sad goodbye scene, where Chelsea needs to go after resigning from her job as advisor and gets relocated to Ivonne as their major. Helga feels insecure at this point in their relationship, that she cannot imagine 



Why does Chelsea leave?

- She attempts to assasinate Edgar with poison Helga provided her. But since Edgar is already dead, nothing happens. He claims to have been trained to withstands many poisons. He removes her from his advisory counsel, and appoints her to be mayor of Ivonne.
- She is sent to make sure the church does not attach their NE borders, (Ivonne is a city on the border of that region)
