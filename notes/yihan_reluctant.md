Yihan: You asked me leave Chundu, the only home I knew, because somehow you got exhiled. I never asked how, or why. I followed you and yur brother here.
Ada: Do you regret coming with us?
Yihan: No, being here in Gale was the best thing that happened to me. I love the life we've built together. I have a job I'm great at in a country that threats me with respect even though we are not citizens. I can forget that was born a subject to a great colonial empire.
*Ada blushes*
Yihan: And you are asking e to throw all that away now, once again. By helping Vio break her sister out of jail, that's what we'll be risking if we get caught! The life you, Alan, and I have built together in Ixan.
Ada: We won't get caught, I promise.
Yihan: Can you really promise me that?
Ada: No I guess not, but even if we do we can find a way to work it out.
Yihan: *sighs and chuckles* How can I forget, you are Adeline Hart, Lady Wickshire. Your family will always bail you out of whatever trouble you get into. Killed a man? We'll let's just pay his loved ones? 
Ada: *winces, remembering the one time when she did indeed killed a man*
Yihan: Start a riot? They've got your bail?! Found conspiring with anarchist against the empire? Let's just send her away, until everyone here forgets.
Ada: Did you forget I joined the cause to free your people from my government?!
If you don't want to help us with Vio's sister you don't have to. You can just stay out of it!
Yihan: That's what you don't understand. I can't! Who do you think they will question first if you or Alan gets caught for leaking security information?!

> Somehow Yihan agrees, so we can have the scene where he uses Ada as leverage to get them out
