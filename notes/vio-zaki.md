# Themes

## forgiveness

How many times is Vio willing to forgive Zaki? Her arc with this theme ends like a fall arc. In which she is test for her belief again and again, and ends up giving up on her belief.

## retribution

Zaki is all about getting back and vio is about letting go. At the end, they revert roles in the way they approach eachother's wrong doings. 

# Chemistry
starts off with social attraction, then connects emotionally in bottle chapter.

maybe their magic dynamic is Vio can be snarky like him when she's only snarky with Sicili. This can be like when two autistic people meet there is a repoire that they can't get with NTs. Like they can never feel natural with them, with the way he idolizes and imprints on Sicili, there is a chance that me might somewhat be on the spectrum too.
