Prelude (70/80s)

deindustrialization, rise of housing price, elim of social welfare. factory jobs earned more than service jobs (gendering of jobs?).

mental health: institution to community based clinics, may seem humanizing at first. cuts to mental health services made by 1/3.

a mayor thought it was a temp problem due to recession. and made temp shelter for single night stays, underfunded.

Food Not Bombs: gave free veggie meals to homeless individuals in Haight, that erked real estate and business. City  arrested the group. They then along with the homeless occupied Civic Center Park. "a shelter is like a prison" and would rather sleep  in the streets.

Matrix program: increased the tickets police would give to homeless for disdeamnors.
Used  police as social service workers.

Clear out camps in GGPark, with helicopters with infrared cameras. But his money came from people who didn't want the homeless there, so his initial campaign promises failed to materialize.

Care not Cash: decreased stipend, to provide shelter and services. Many found shelter via SRO in vacant hotel rooms.

Shipping people home, "forced people to return to abusive households".

Building heigh restrictions (beautify, earthquake?)

Increased of tech jobs outpaced increase of housing. 400k 60k

71% had housing before.
nyc has a right to shelter to provide minimal shelter beds. clearing of tents causes pyschological damage from always having to move.
structural trauma that got people on the streets (job lost, eviction) makes them more likely to enter drug use.

# Bussing people around
- cities ban you from the shelter with your ticket
- move to cheaper cities, with less support
