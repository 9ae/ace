Refusal to the call, anchored in self-dobut, fear, beyond their abilities to fix. Recipe for diaster.

Yearning: who she hopes to be, what life does she want to lead?
Reckoning with one's destiny. Who do we **need** to be to get what we **want**? 

Without being driven by that calling like most readers, protagonist is not motivated to answer to the call. Debating on whether or not to answer to the call is their internal conflict.

Can be pushed by mentor, or dire circumstances (Sicili's safety).
What do they care about most?! What will they fight to protect regardless of the consequences.

By embracing their calling, they are themselves forever changed.
