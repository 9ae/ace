# How

**Show how well they understand eachother**
- Fears
- Shame
- feelings they are too embarrased to tell anyone else.... they are both insecure, and uses the fact that someone likes them to make them forget how insignficant they feel.

Ada in private asks Alan more about his relationship. We are shown how they had stood by eachother through their failed romances.

Ada: I've seen you heart broken too many times, and it breaks my heart too you know.
I just want to hurt them back, so badly... all the guys who have hurt you.

Alan: And I tried. Think of all those time you held me back from punchs your exes.

# Why
Shows how dependent the Hart siblings are one eachother. Show the readers, they understand something about eachother that no one does.

# and so?
Ada and Yihan agrees to go tail Adolf.
