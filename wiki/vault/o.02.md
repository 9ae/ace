[Summary](https://github.com/9ae/ace/issues/268)

> angry, cathadric, heroic

We learn more about **why Zaki** wants to be part of the citizen's uprising.
What is the political situation in Galei?

Vio tries to use preparation method when interacting with people, but fails when they go off the script she had intented.

*How do we make a revenge plot that in itself is an inciting incident for the whole story?*
The victim of venegence is now motivated to enact revenge for the hurt they have received. And this kicks off the plot for the rest of the book.
*Who is the revenge seeker?* Someone who's loved ones Zaki had kill is after him.
*Who is the initial villian?* Zaki
*What did they IV do to RS to justify RS's actions?*
*What is RS going to do?* What if Zaki was initially working with Lessa, and the RS had killed her.
*How does IV respond to it? And what do they do to kick off the larger plot?*
Zaki feels the only way to keep his new found life safe is to eliminate the threat.

*How does this tie in with the citizen's uprising?*
- It can be a politician that he killed
- Or a fellow Hastuit
- Edgar, through the control of one advisor... though it's harder to make them sympathetic.

Set up as Mr & Mrs Smith.

What are convincing revenge stories, where the audience is on the side of the avenger?
- Kill Bill
  - why? She is cool, struggling, and smart. Even though she seems to possess inhuman capabilities, she has very human emotions that anyone can relate to.
- The Crow
  - They raped and killed people for funzies. You too come to hate the people. Their act of violence seems random like a natural diaster. You don't see them as people but as forces of chaos to be stopped.
- V for Vendetta
  - revenge against a whole order is more justifyable than individuals

*What are the active characters in this chapter?*
Zaki tries to do right by the org. They are actually responsible for the bombing so they tell him to lay low and not par-take in the execution protest. In which he was planning to rescue his mentor. Zaki's internal conflict is should he let his mentor die for a greater purpose? He ends up choosing to save his mentor. But fail.

Sicili believes in forgiveness for religious purposes.
Vio believes in forgiveness because she is afraid to lose any connection. She always believes it is what separate them from beast, to hold restraint and not act on instinct. She believes it all a larger part of *discipline*.

# Ordinary World
> (start with lack) Show your main character (MC) and their normal life, including friends, family, job/school. What flaws do they have? What’s missing from their life? What do they want more than anything in the world? 

![[s.2_00]]
(do we do a flashback? How will it provide context?)
![[s.2_01]]
![[s.2_04]]
 
# Inciting Incident 
> Boom! Something big changes. Maybe a stranger moves to town, or a family member dies, or there’s an earthquake. Whatever it is, it kicks your story into action. What happens? How does your MC react? Do they accept this call to adventure right away, or try to ignore/deny what’s happening so everything can just go back to normal?

![[s.2_02]]
![[s.2_03]]

# First Plot Point
> (point of no return) – Your MC may have tried to avoid the call, but now things are getting weirder/more intense, and they’re forced to make a choice to join the action. Everything changes - there’s no going back now! How does the situation escalate? What forces your MC to choose? How do they feel about it all?

![[s.2_19]]
 
# First Pinch Point
> (first battle) – Your MC has been exploring their new situation - meeting people, learning new things....and discovering new dangers and tensions. This all leads to the First Pinch Point, which is the first major interaction with the antagonist (in some form). What happens? What will happen if your MC fails to defeat this challenge at the end of the story (the stakes)?  

![[s.2_06]]
![[s.2_07]]

# Midpoint
> (shift from victim to warrior) – Your MC continues to face new challenges, but they’re on the defense - mostly reacting, waiting, making things worse. Then, halfway through the novel, something happens to shift their perspective and spur them to take action, to stop reacting and start winning, no matter what it takes. What does your MC try when they’re on the defense? What shifts them into offense? What new plans do they make? 

![[s.2_13]]
![[s.2_14]]

# Second Pinch Point
> (second battle) – Your MC has their second confrontation with the antagonist (in some form). Maybe their plans lead to this, or maybe it was an attack they had to respond to. Either way, this second conflict eventually leads to things being much, much worse than they were before… What happens? What does your MC try to do? How do things get worse?

![[s.2_17]]

# Second Plot Point
> (dark night of the soul) – At this point, everything the MC feared could happen, has happened. They’ve lost the battle (usually because of their flaw or lack of knowledge) and there have been serious consequences. They feel terrible and give up all hope… until something forces them to change their mind, to have a revelation about themselves and their battle. With this new knowledge, they rise up from the ashes. What terrible things have happened? What does your MC do? What revelation do they have, and what new plans do they make?

![[s.2_09]]

# Final Battle
> (triumph-knowledge) – With their new knowledge, and maybe a pep talk from a close friend, your MC goes to battle with their biggest, baddest enemy (whatever that means in your story). Make it dramatic! There’s a back and forth, things seem dark, your MC is going to lose, oh no! And then, victory. What will that final conflict be? What will be the most exciting, tense, drama-filled part of your story?
