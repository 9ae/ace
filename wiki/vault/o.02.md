[Summary](https://github.com/9ae/ace/issues/268)

> angry, cathadric, heroic

We learn more about **why Zaki** wants to be part of the citizen's uprising.
What is the political situation in Galei?

Vio tries to use preparation method when interacting with people, but fails when they go off the script she had intented.

*How do we make a revenge plot that in itself is an inciting incident for the whole story?*
The victim of venegence is now motivated to enact revenge for the hurt they have received. And this kicks off the plot for the rest of the book.
*Who is the revenge seeker?* Someone who's loved ones Zaki had kill is after him.
*Who is the initial villian?* Zaki
*What did they IV do to RS to justify RS's actions?*
*What is RS going to do?* What if Zaki was initially working with Lessa, and the RS had killed her.
*How does IV respond to it? And what do they do to kick off the larger plot?*
Zaki feels the only way to keep his new found life safe is to eliminate the threat.

*How does this tie in with the citizen's uprising?*
- It can be a politician that he killed
- Or a fellow Hastuit
- Edgar, through the control of one advisor... though it's harder to make them sympathetic.

Set up as Mr & Mrs Smith.

What are convincing revenge stories, where the audience is on the side of the avenger?
- Kill Bill
  - why? She is cool, struggling, and smart. Even though she seems to possess inhuman capabilities, she has very human emotions that anyone can relate to.
- The Crow
  - They raped and killed people for funzies. You too come to hate the people. Their act of violence seems random like a natural diaster. You don't see them as people but as forces of chaos to be stopped.
- V for Vendetta
  - revenge against a whole order is more justifyable than individuals

*What are the active characters in this chapter?*
Zaki tries to do right by the org. They are actually responsible for the bombing so they tell him to lay low and not par-take in the execution protest. In which he was planning to rescue his Halim. Zaki's internal conflict is should he let his Halim die for a greater purpose? He ends up choosing to save his Halim. But fail.

Sicili believes in forgiveness for religious purposes.
Vio believes in forgiveness because she is afraid to lose any connection. She always believes it is what separate them from beast, to hold restraint and not act on instinct. She believes it all a larger part of *discipline*.

**Only Vio is illegal, Sicili is a registered resident**

- [ ] Weave the Order's presence into this chapter, so next chapter won't be as jarring.
- [ ] Why is Erik not in this at all?
- [ ] teaser scene with Zaki feels weird to be reflecting on a girl since his mentor just died.
  - What if we move the supposed teaser seen to be the night after he meet Sicili, but before the execution.
    - We'll have to find a chance to give him a cut on the cheek before the execution.
- [ ] Kill Jacques withdrawing from gov scene. Keep them still under Edgar's payroll.
- [ ] Remember to have the line where Zaki saids being Hastuit in Galei is like being a permnament guest in someone's house.
