# What happens
Walking out of the cathedral, Zaki ask Vio why she din't kill him.

Vio explains that she realized Yule was just a victim. Plus, killing him won't bring her family or his family back.
And together they can look for his brother together.

Vio explains an keeping the connection with him is instrumental to bring down The Order.

Zaki praises of how strategic she is being.

Vio explains that she was raised to be the leader of a warlord clan. Even though she does not have the talent to play political manuvers because she can't read people, not all of her lesson are put to waste.

##  Why it matters
Vio despite her rage still thinks she is choosing forgiveness. Also because she values every connection she has with the people in her life, she is unwilling to let any one of them go.

Zaki starts to questions his motivations, if going after Edgar is the smartest thing to do.

# Consequence
Vio ask how can they first send a message to Edgar.
Zaki proposes through the executioner.
Vio says she still doesn't like it because he was just carrying out orders. But they had a deal, and she will follow through.
Vio ask how do they figure out who the executioner is, Zaki saids he remembers his eyes and can draw them out.
(The executioner has all but their eyes hidden).

They banter along the way.

## The realization
Vio thinks that Zaki might like her. Even though she doesn't like him, she feels flattered and entertains the idea.

## and so?
They arrive at the Hart's place
