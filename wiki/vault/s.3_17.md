# What happens
Walking out of the cathedral, Zaki ask Vio why she din't kill him.

Vio explains that she realized Yule was just a victim. Plus, killing him won't bring her family or his family back.
And together they can look for his brother together.

##  Why it matters
Vio despite her rage still thinks she is choosing forgiveness. Also because she values every connection she has with the people in her life, she is unwilling to let any one of them go.

Zaki starts to questions his motivations, if going after Edgar is the smartest thing to do.

# Consequence
Segway into talking about their plan to send Edgar a message.

They banter along the way.

## The realization
Vio thinks that Zaki might like her. Even though she doesn't like him, she feels flattered and entertains the idea.

## and so?
They arrive at the Hart's place
