# Who
*Alan* excited to share more of his life with Adolf.
*Adolf* flusterd about spending time with someone as a boyfriend. It's been a while since he's been in a relationship.

# When
The evening before they plan to go to the high ball card game.

# Where
Hart's flat

# What
Keep most of the [og scene](https://github.com/9ae/ace/blob/master/chapters/04.md#alan-and-adolf-have-dinner).

Take out Alan's thought about stalking Juliette?

Change what Alan is saying about the gov v order.
Maybe talk about the death of an executioner, and how Edgar is responding to it.
Or hint at the Order is preparing to scheme for the government to fall and take it's place!

# How
Adolf's scar scene.

Hint about why Adolf will want to work under Juliette, other than her being a great mother figure. He does it for safety and protection.

# Why
This is the calm before the storm for Alan & Adolf. Their last sweet moment together before Alan fucks everything up. So the purpose of this scene is to also make the audience go "awwww".

# and so?
Alan hopes Adolf will one day be comfortable enough with him to tell the story of his scar.
