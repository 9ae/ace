# Who
*Sicili* is upset for Vio for being constantly trying to control her life.
*Yule* is conflicted about the things Roderick orders him to do. Even though he is not a huge believer of the prophet, he still feels in his gut what he is doing is wrong.

# When
Late morning.

# Where
Instead of the main cathedral this is at the church Sicili is volunteering at.

# What
Yule comes into the confession box.

Yule: (something religion specific)

Sicili: (replies in kind) Are you ready to rinse free of your sins?

Yule: Yes. I guess I should start from the beginning?

Sicili: You may start from whenever you chose. My duty here is not to form a clear narrative from what you tell me. But cleanse your heart from the words you provide.

Yule: My family lived in the mountains in the Falcon tribe. Fertile lands were so rare in the mountains. We fought with other tribes over plateaus to farm, and caves to take shelter in form the snow. We moved constantly, never spent more than twice turn of the seasons in one place. I wanted a tree that I can point to, and tell my children of the stories my brother and I had climbing it. I wanted land, we could call our own. I was tired of fighting! (break this up into scenes) `chock out tears`

Sicili: *I knwow the strain of waring families all to well, it was this state of constant rivalry that had my fate sealed from birth* Responsibility can take such a toll on us.

Yule: Yes, and I wanted to do right for my tribe. But also for all tribes, so no mountain child will ever have to lose a parent in battle again. If we can just all just live in peace. But there was no higher power to ensure that. Brokering peace has never been part of the culture of the mountainmen. So we just fought. Until one day, the Order came offering peace, if we allied with them. I knew that if I joined, I'll be surrendering my own freedom and will to them for a long time. But what is my happiness compared to the safety of hundreds of mountainmen. If I can bring peace to my people, then my sacrifice is worth it. (show Sicili and Yule's reactions through this)

Sicili: Sacrifice a highly over looked virtue these days,
`flashback to her tutor "The highest value of a lady is her willingness for sacrifice"`

Yule: Thank you Sister. I was the only one of my tribe who joined, everyone else, my family and friends, they took away. I thought they would keep them until their conquest of the mountains were over. To make sure they aren't a threat, and return them to Order allotted lands for them in the mountains. But, there was an incident at the place they were held. And all the detainees went missing!

Sicili: What happened to them? `realized she had violated protocol for pushing the confessor.`

Yule: I searched the archives all week. There's been no record of that had happened other than a note in saying that fortress is not in operation. I don't know if my little brother is dead or alive.

Sicili thought of the years, she and Vio had spent apart after they had been seperated by the bandits. Both wondering if they will see eachother again. When Vio turned up at their flat's door a few years ago, it was as if Lady Lygeia had granted a miracle. They held eachother tightly, Vio cried for hours vowing to never let them part again. It was the first time she had seen her sister cry.

Yule: He was my little brother! I was suppose to protection him no matter what. And I failed! I... joined The Order to bring peace to the lands and security to the family. `sobs` Ironic, they are now all gone. And I've engaged in multitudes of more blood shed since, than I would have ever had in the tribal disputes.

Sicili thinks back to the fight she had with Vio this morning.

Sicili: Oh yes. Sorry. It's just I have a sister too. *Darn it! I broke another rule. I wasn't suppose to tell anything to the confessor about myself* (Change this to be more doctrine sounding). *Before this session she had never broken any rules*
the... the goal...It is the goal of our faith is to bring peace to all people before they pass. You have the will of our prophet, What would she have done? 

Yule: She..., `he pauses for a long moment. And slams his fist on the metal screen, leaning in very closely. They were now only several inches apart, separated by the division in the confession box.`
I don't know... I want to live by her example. But sometimes... lately the orders I've had to follow. She would not have...

Sicili: Were they orders or choices?

Yule: They... I was. I had to... Choices. The prophet said, each and every step we take is our free will. Even if we didn't think there is, there will always be another path.

Sicili: Maybe think about that next time, when confronted with a choice. Lady Lygeia is dead, the order now follows her son. Who do you want to serve?

Yule: Thank you sister

`Sicili could smell the lavender scent of his breathe through the screen. He sits back up right.`

Sicili: May the prophet bless your every step

Yule: may she bless your every breathe.

# How

Ok. It doesn't change that much about Vio wanting to protect Sicili. Should we make it so? If not we can keep this as it is.

Describe how this interaction makes her rethink her disagreements with Vio.

When she gets out of the confession box, they both recognize eachother.

Yule: Wait, you don't need to go.

`Even though she wasn't suppose to she turned to face him`

Yule: Thank you, for listening. `smiling awkwardly`

`Sicili smiles back`.

# Why
They connected immediately on first chat, and wasn't even aware of it either.
The feeling Sicili felt was lacking with Zaki, she felt with Yule.
They both recognize there was something deep about their connection.

# and so?
Sicili decides to try to patch things up with Vio.
Roderick decides that he sould not just blindly follow orders if they conflict with his moral inkling.
