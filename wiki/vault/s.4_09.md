## __Bits to keep__

> Neither of the Hart siblings had actually been in relationships. Whenever they got close to being with someone, then their potentail partner always ends up choosing either be with someone else, stay single, or move away. The abandonment always happened so suddenly, one moment they are happy and hopeful, the next one sibling is crying into the other's shoulders for weeks.


> Alan: everyone loved him, did you know he got voted class president for three years in a row?! People tolerated me because I was just funny. Like I was the joke, and I acted like I didn't mind, so they kept me around.
> "Did you mind?" ask Helga.
> "Who wouldn't mind being laughed at all the time?!" says Alan. "But it was better than being all alone."
> "You're not alone, you always had your older sister." says Helga.
> "Ada then was too caught up in her notebook of calcuations and theorems to notice. And when she's not, she's too always heart broken over some idiot who took advantage of her firm belief that everyone has some good in them." Alan paused to caught his breath in the middle of his rant. When he started again, his paced his words slower, as if he is slowly thinking through.
> "Maybe I am a bad brother. No matter how much I try to keep the assholes away, I let them hurt Ada in the end. I can build big scary monster trucks, but I can't do anything if some jerk decides to run his wheels right on my sister's heart."

> "I'm trying to get him out of it though. I can get him a job with a real orchestra," says Alan.
> "And that's something he wants?" ask Helga.
> Alan shrugs, "Why would he not?!"
> Helga: "Well.." just then Ada and Yihan walk into the garage

# How
[Ada reports back with news via a mirror comm.](https://github.com/9ae/ace/blob/master/chapters/04.md#ada-comes-back-with-paper-work)

Instead of bond papers they, come back with a list of all Juliette's clients and who they see.

> "In fact, we can win Adolf's freedom in one night!" delclares Ada.

> "How?" ask Alan. "It's a small sum, but way more than what we have in our savings."

# Why
Why don't they just blackmail her? Because they want to play fair, and don't believe in robbing anyone if they don't deserve it. 

**Alan** is excited they have a 2-tier plan.

# and so?
They plan to buy Adolf out from Juliette, and if she refuses then they can always blackmail her.

Helga mentions Juliette must have body guards. She'll love to help but her arm is still in a sling.
