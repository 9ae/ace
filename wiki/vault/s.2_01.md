# What happens
Vio screams and cries from her nightmare

##  Why it matters
Vio is terrified of being separated from her sister again. Maybe only Vio is illegal and Sicili has a green card.

# Consequence
Zaki also gets woken up. She apologizes and saids these nightmares happen every night.

## The realization

## and so?
Zaki saids he may know a cure for her and they can do that first thing in the morning.
