# What happens
Vio screams and cries from her nightmare.

##  Why it matters
Vio is terrified of being separated from her sister again. Maybe only Vio is illegal and Sicili has a green card.

# Consequence
Zaki also gets woken up from her screaming. He sees her dripping in cold sweat.
We see him with a cross bandage around his chest bare.
They are sleeping foot to toe.
Vio is shaking and whispering her sister's name and takes a few moments to notice Zaki. She blushes, and then apologizes for waking him up.
He ask if what is wrong?
She saids nothing, just nightmarees; they happen every night.

## The realization
Zaki too used to suffer from nightmares after his parents death. And it was his mentor who has given him medication to make them stop.

## and so?
Zaki saids he may know a cure for her and they can do that first thing in the morning.
