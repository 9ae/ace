# Who
*Vio* is bitter about Sicili leaving to volunteer for an institution tore her family apart.
*Sicili* sees the work she is doing as still helpful

# When
Morning

# Where
Their apartment

# What
As Sicili is about to leave for chuch, Vio comments on how she can still do that after she finds out The Order is responsible for Atonia's downfall.

Vio thinks all churches are bad because they pay taxes to the Order. And they got their parents killed.

# How
Sicili explains that not all churches are supportive of The Order, and regardless of what the Order does the stuff she does in the name of faith is helping other people.

Vio stubbornly she is allowing them to use her.

Sicili says, no she is doing this form the people of Ixan. In a huff, she leaves.

# Why
To show how sometimes black and white Vio's thinking can be too.

# and so?
The sisters start of being mad at eachother. It's the first time they had a disagreement in the series. This makes their relationship more realistic. Even though they are very tight, they still fight.
