# Who
*Vio* upset from her fight with Sicili this morning.

# When
In the afternoon, it's raining. Grey & red.

# Where
A training room, Vio is helping Helga rehabilitate from her injury.

# What
Helga ask how Sicili is doing. Vio tells him about the fight they had.
Helga agrees she has a right to be mad. But think of it from Sicili's perspective who just wants to help. Vio says that true, all Sicili ever wanted was to help. And she never had to think about the bigger picture and politics.

# How
Vio decides to be easier on Sicili and consider things from her POV, which doesn't come naturally to her. And they talk about how this is especially challenging for her, and Vio talks about the ways she'll need to employ to empathize with people.

# Why
To show Vio's growth and her working with her trouble in seeing things from other people's perspective.

# and so?
Vio goes home to apologize to Sicili.
