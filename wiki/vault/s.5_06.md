# Who
*Zaki* is chipper
*Vio* feels drained from having to mask her emotions while standing there with Zaki

# When
In the afternoon, it's raining. Grey & red

# Where
Streets of Ixan

# What
Zaki ask how Sicili is doing. Vio tells him about the fight they had.
Zaki agrees she has a right to be mad. But think of it from Sicili's perspective who just wants to help. Vio says that true, all Sicili ever wanted was to help. And she never had to think about the bigger picture and politics.
Vio decides to be easier on Sicili and consider things from her POV, which doesn't come naturally to her. And they talk about how this is especially challenging for her, and Vio talks about the ways she'll need to employ to empathize with people.

# How
They segway ta talk about how Zaki's date went. Zaki thinks it went well. Vio knowing otherwise smiles and says she's glad and thinks they can be happy together. Then she looks away with down cast eyes.

# Why
To show how much Vio is repressing her feelings

# and so?
Vio goes home to apologize to Sicili.
