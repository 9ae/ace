# Who
*Vio* starts to feel uncertain if she can make this out alive

# When
The greyish turning red

# Where
Inside the church

# What
Vio ask Zaki to take care of Sicili for her if anything happens. Zaki promises.

# How
A fight ensues, Vio is surrounded and for the first time we see her lose ground. It looks like she might not win this. She looks at Zaki and whispers "Sicili" with a begging eye. One of them slashes her leg and we see her falling to the ground to bleed. She closes her eyes and winces, then when she opens them again they are completely white.

# Why

This is the first time we see Vio fugue in present time. It is the first time Zaki has seen this at all or learned about it.

# and so?
She ends up killing almost everyone in the room.
