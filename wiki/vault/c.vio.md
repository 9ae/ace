# At Glance

Other names: Vio

Birthday: December 7
Sagittarius

Place of Origin: Renova, [[Atonia|p.atonia]]

Job: (what do they do and how did they get started)
Vio is a hired assassin.
*How did she get to work for Jacques?*
- *When did she arrive to Ixan?* What happened? Sicili and her got cornered while walking home one night by a street gang. She killed all of them in one go. Jacques was hired to arrest them, and saw the scene. He hired her into his private security company.



## Introduction ideas

## Reader catch
Asa I reader, I relate to Vio through because she is deeply weird.
She's self defeating, angsty.

## Catch Phrase

- Inadequate
  - > It was nothing.
- Rejected
  - > Not again...
- Isolated
  - > No one understands
  - > You don't understand
- Disillusions
  - > They always...

She doesn't speak much, but when she does, she has a sharp tongue. Lessa and Zaki brings out the more talkative side of her. 

How to write autistic characters with good dialogue?
Entrapta draws us in with her sense of wonder. Despite being jaded what are characteristics if Vio inspires us to believe in a better world? She is constantly giving everyone the benefit of the doubt, despite her solidary nature and fear of people. She secretly yearns to be surrounded by people. Anyone that is willing to be part of her life, she is too afraid to lose. 

*What is her vunerability that makes her relatable to readers?*
Vio had always been a romantic at heart. She hides it because she was brought up to be a fighter and a leader. Since her family had been kidnapped and held for ransome many times, she didn't think it was reasonable for someone in leadership position to have loved ones. She doesn't want that to happen to her spouse or children.

But even so, she's had many obsesive crushes. Even though the she never outwardly admits it, the reader can see she is gaga for Zaki, when he reveals that he likes Sicili. 

She talks to imaginary Lessa and Erik.

# Goals

> To bring down The Order. It's the only goal that makes sense for all that it's done to her.
> We end with her deciding that it is Roderick she needs to stop.

Vio is with org who thinks the Order is up to no good.
Gov (and Zaki under their hire) is chill with the Order until they try taking over Galei.
The org temporarily aligns with the gov??
**How does Yule and Vio reconceal?**


*How are they dissastisfied with their life?*
It doesn't have to even be the reason for the inciting incident. It can come fulfilled in the adventure she winds herself in.
We saw so much of Frankie in the pilot. Since Vio is the protagonist we should see this about her in ch 1.
This can be the root of her need. In this series, her need is to believe in herself and take ownership of her powers. Why doe she need this? Because she can't be an appropriate protector for Sicili if she doesn't take ownership of her strength.

**She is tired of this life, and wonders when they can feel fully safe. **

Her fear is herself, she doesn't trust herself. And she truly believes she's cursed, she also had no words for her autism. She feels alone, and believing she'll bring her loved once misfortune only isolates her more.

Zaki breaks her out of her shell, so does Helga and Ada.


*What do they think will bring the true happiness?*
Other than Sicili what is she living for?
What makes her a big believer in forgiveness? Truly, she can't afford to let anyone go. 
To be exocrised from whatever darkness that lurks inside her. In that way is she like Vanessa Ives... thought she doesn't pursue it because in this series she's still ashamed it. So she doesn't even acknowledge it herself.
**living a peaceful life with Sicili**

*What definitive step could they take to turn their dream into a reality?*
Find out who Lessa's murderer is.
Advocate for illegal residents a path to obtain citizenship.

*How has their fear keep them from taking action already?*
She doesn't know what she will do when she finds them. What if it wasn't a target attack on the family. Will she confront them? Will she take revenge? There is a part of her that does, even though she won't fully admit it. Zaki draw that part out of her. Her fear is herself, she doesn't want to face that she partially wants revenge.

*How do they feel they can accomplish their goal while steering clear of the thing they are most afraid of?* By keeping a low profile.

# Arc

Threads:
- Lessa's murder investigation
- Protecting Sicili

- Stopping the Order from gaining more control over Galei
- Being enticed into revenge as she becomes a more active person.

- Dealing with her powers
- Struggling with autism



Allegory to discovering my own abilities througout highschool.
We skipped freshmen year (when Vio came to Ixan).
Act 1: Sophmore year ~ Chaos! call to action
Act 2: Junior year ~ Training montagues
Act 3: Senior year ~ lost penultimate battle, darkest hour, dusting off to fight final battle

*How does the Lessa plot challenge her to grown?*
She is confronted with her own hypocracy.

*What do they believe in?*
Forgiveness
> Not forgiving is turning your back on a friend. Now your enemy may stab you at anytime.
The family that attacked them were once allies that Illyria didn't forgive.

Denial

Victimhood

*Fear holding her back*
Have her talk about her experience of the fugue state with Erik. "I don't know what is real or imagined?" She wants to avoid fighting, but that is all she thinks she is good for.

Overcoming:
- show power and fugue state early
- show how she feels about them
- show why does she feel this way
- put her in challenges where she must face/overcome this fear
- ahha moment of realizing she must definitively let go of this fear
- accomplishes her goal after letting go of this fear

Along on the journey who will become her anchor to make her feel safe as she dip her toes into her powers.
Zaki: almost stranger, feels like she can tell him anything. Leans into his own powers.
Ada: Non-judgemental, is someone who will always use what she has to get what she wants.

`TODO how does this journey play into the theme of forgiveness?`


*Journey (how they learn about it)?*

**Turning point** when she finds Zaki likes Sicili. She processes her emotions by throwing herself deeper into work. And promises to help him get to her her sister better. The butterfly exhibit can be a moment when she steps outs to give them a chance to hangout, while she helps Alan.


---
# Current life

What does she do when she's not working?
Now she mostly is looking for Lessa's killer.
Before I guess she would hang out with her cousin.
Other than that she's training, she likes **learning martial arts styles from across the lands**. She has a thing with control, and believes as long as she feels not threatened the beast in her won't come out. **This hobby makes her desire to learn Zaki's street fighting style and how to pick pockets a lot more in character.**

## Daily Routine

6am - noon : sleeps
afternoon - evening : trains
9pm starts work
2/3am sometimes finishes early and visits Lessa. They hang out.

# People
Answer:
1. How do they see this character?
2. How does this character see them?
3. What archetypes does their role in the story play?
4. What is the progression of this relationship?


## Family

Vio who never wanted to be the leader was groomed for leadership like Lessa, their family plain for Sici was to marry her off to form a political alliance. Vio while not wanting to deal with the politcs of leadership, never envisioned a life outside her family's business. She would have been happy to help Lessa lead, behind the scenes as a strategist.

### Sicili
![[r.sici_vio]]

### Lessa
On nights when she finishes early, she goes to visit Lessa who is probably still up. Lessa takes her out and tries to pull Vio out of her comfort zone.

After she died, she went to Lessa's place out of habit. And she'll still talk to an imaginary Lessa throught s1, when she feels stuck.

If we show how important Lessa was to Vio, other than their birth rival expectations, then it will make more sense why she is **tempted into avenge her cousin's death.**

### Illyria & Nomaru
Both were pretty absent since they had to run their territory. 

## Friends

*Something terrible has happened to everyone of her crushes. So she's afraid to like anyone now.*
Her childhood friend was sacrificed, even though she doesn't remember.
Maybe a fortune teller once hold her that she is a curse to those she loves. She truly believes there is evil inside her. Since since she goes through violent fugue states, she is within reason.

### Erik
Went missing, she assumed he is dead. Since her memory of Yule is tainted by the fact that he joined up with the Order. Erik symbolizes her time living with the mountain tribe. It was the happiest time of her life, and her attachment to the memory of him. Ok, we cna't totally write him off because he'll appear in memory spectre form. So her perceptions of him determine how we actually see him.
She sees him as cocky. They banter; which is the one of the only times you see her do so. Since she is pretty quiet around live people.

He looks at Galeian politics with a simple mind, the mountain tribes had always thought the Atonians, Cellians, and even Galeians are silly and frivolous. So he points out all the ridiculous things they do. In a way, he's both the voice for Vio in how she finds life normally. *But he is also our proxy for looking into this world.* He is fascinated by the political structure but also the technology. *Since he lives inside her head, he challenges the lies she tells herself.*

archetypes: cool imaginary best friend. He is her wonder.

### Yule
![[r.vio_yule]]

### Zaki
![[r.vio_zaki]]

### Ada
Ada reminds Vio of Lessa, in how she jumps in head first. They have a few moments of finishing eachother, but they don't interact much during s1. They get to know eachother more during s2, whe Vio tries to get Ada to join her cause, and all Ada cares about is partying.


## Colleagues

### Helga
Vio's closest friend in the org. Why are they close? They are one of the few girls who work there. The other girls stay away from Helga, because there is some transphobia amongst them. Vio was the only girl who didn't mind, and partnered with her during training. 

### Rein
Vio's mentor

### Jacques
Does he know about Vio's power?

# Backstory

*What is the best thing that happend in their life?*
Her time with the mountains tribes was the happiest time in her life. She was witha choosen family, with no heavy expectations. Yule believed in her, and she never had anyone believe in her. At that time, she didn't realize it was the **church who was pulling the strings stowing conflict in Atonia.**
The mountain's people life, though communal, was less socially pressured than Atonian life. They threw celebrations as a way to bound with eachother, where Atonia's threw parties to show off. They were more direct and mean the things they say, as opposed to polite lies.
Instead of explict flashbacks to her time with the mountain people, we can get an idea of what her life is with them by her conversations with Erik.

*What is the worst thing that happend in their life?*
Her family being raided or the church coming to the mountains? Given the prior it is the church coming? What if it was neither, it was seeing her childhood best friend die. Consciously, it's probably the church raiding.

## Learned their lie

What is the lie that she believes in? That she's incapable and her powers are dangerous.

*What did they go into the scene believing and how they are surprised by the outcome?*
During this raid, she was too confident in her abilities. She had secretly been wanting to get into this awesome fighting state. Her flaw here was wanting power for power stake. She got what she wanted. And rushed into danger resulting her get caught up and going into fighting fugue. Up until then she saw that state as something to grant her strength, but then realized that it can do great harm.

*How do they struggle to hold on to their old belief?*
What is the internal struggle they cope with that results her deciding that her powers are evil? She feels guillt over what happened, instead of trying to figure out how to master her powers. She shoves it away, and tries to not trigger them again. This is driven by her internal belief that she in incapable, something hammered in by her parents, who always seemed disappointed in her.

*What is their conclusion/new beief?*
That her powers are evil. She believe now as long as she has the upperhand, her fighting fugue state won't incur.

# Reasons

## Motivations
The desire to protect Sicili, it is almost an obsession. It hides away the fact that she is very jealous of Sici - reaction formation.
She also wants acceptence, and even Sicili is the only one who does.

What's a story we can tell from her voice that makes her motivated? How did she end up in Ixan? 

Oh we can make someone her rival, and she becomes motivated to succeed.

```
I can't say that it didn't bother me. He can be with whoever he wants, after all what are we even really. Two strangers thrown in violence circumstances together. And Sicili, of course it's always sweet Sicili everyone falls for. She's kind; I'm a killer.

I kill to protect her.

The punching bag lets out a spray of stand, after my feet lands on it. We all have a purpose.
```

## Fears
*How does her losts inform her fears?*
Choose one to tackle each series.

1. **Self**
  - Living with the mystery of not knowing why she blacks out.
  - Connection to readers who are afraid of their own desires, abilities, or thoughts.
    - How does religious morality play into their own fears of self?
    - Can we make it an allegory for the homosexual experience?
    - She believes she is touched by the devil.
   - Wuxia trope of "evoporated spirit, enters the demon". Is about fear of isolation, power, and getting too deep. **afraid of the truth**.
`TODO is this fear relevant to enough readers to make it the main thing this character has to overcome during s1? Need more examples of how she feels about it. We don't need to touch on the cause of the powers but the effects.` That is the purpose of art, you should talk about things that are important to you, that others don't talk very much about.

2. **Lost**
  - **Being uprooted again** The church has killed both her family and chosen family. She is afraid of really settling down, surrendering to any sense of security.
  - **Of letting people down**, of not being able to protect people she loves. 
  `TODO if her response to disconnect is similiar to how Ada deals with lost, how does s2 play out for them with them dealing with the same thing but coping differently.`
3. **Rejection**
  - Not being good enough to protect Sicili
  - People will discover how weird and socially awkward she is.
    - It's not something she notices in the moment, but finds out later when she over hears people talking about her.
    - She doesn't know if she's done something wrong until after, and especially if people are mad because they expect something of her that she isn't aware of needing to do.
  - Large crowds, public speaking (which is what makes her ascension to take leadership of the org so impressive)
  `TODO How does this play into her buddying relationship with Zaki?`

Her autism lead her to have a history of rejection. Which gives her social anxiety, and resulted her sending more time in isolation.
She longs for acceptance and connection, which is what she feels with Zaki. Because of how doesn't want to risk losing any connection, she forgives too quick even if in her heart she doesn't.
Her relationship with Zaki is her coming to terms about how she might need to hold onto her anger for longer?


## Values
**Forgiveness:** has an obsession with discipline, obsessed with learning to control instincts. She believes it will be the key to help her gain control over her fugue state. Extreme forgiveness is an act of self-control of holding back out baser instincts to hit back.

## Happy when
When people believe in her.
When she can find someone she connects with...

## Gives them hope

**Forgiveness will bring peace**
Sicili makes her believe there may be still good in the world if you just believe and live by the words of the prophet. Reminds her with that people of the church are still helping the vulnerable.
*If warring factions can learn to forgive eachother and work together, then they can unite against the conquering Order.*

Vio is constantly willing to give all character who have wronged her the benefit of the doubt.
- Yule for joining with The Order
- Forgiving Helga for comprosing their mission
- Rescuing Zaki

**There is a place where she belongs** with the mountain tribes. From working with Yule she sees that as a commander he’s brought tribe virtues to his troops. That the culture of the mountain tribes does not have to be restricted to the mountains.

**Despite her autism she can**:
- still be a leader despite her autism.
- Lessa makes her believe that she too can be normal
- will find love

Her fear of losing Sicili helps her overcome of her insecurities with her unnamed autism.
Show how much shame she feels, over each infraction. And yet she gets up and try again anyway.

Move readers: Show her martial arts obsession is just a cover up for how anxious and out of control she constantly feel. She is constantly talking to herself or Erik.

We see how she has to mentally prepare for all the things she is nervous about. Bring examples of the embarrasing amount of prep work one puts into the simplest interactions.

She is surprised whenever she discovers she can do something she had thought was impossible for her.

**She is not evil**
Zaki embraces her darkness and promises to be her anchor when she needs him.
It's like your partner going with you to move out of your abusive parent's place. ie: Adam and Ronan from Raven Boys.


## Feels alive when

**Lessa** by pushing her out of her comfort zone. Lessa brings joy and excitment to her life in Ixan. Which had been feeld wil responsiblities and trying to maintain control. She let her get let go of some of that control in a non-threatening way.

---

# Perspective

Believes in forgivess in a personal level, and exhiling criminals.

## How do they see themselves?
Vio sees herself as someone who is constantly misunderstood. She fears that she may never be worthy of love and acceptence. That is why she clings on to Sicili's safety so much, because right now Sicili is the only person Vio thinks will love her.

Her journey is to show she can become a great introverted leaders. She discovers that other's believe in her, if only she can belief in herself. 

## How do they see others?
She finds people strange. The unpredictability of their behaviors make her feel like she can't truly trust anyone. She was torn by Yule joining the Order. Because of early childhood bullying, she is terrified of people. Even though she desperately longs for connection with others.
She has pretend conversations in her head with some of the people in her life. At first it started because she had to rehearse for social interactions, she she ran what she wanted to say in her head many times. Then it became a habit, she'll have pretend coversations with people even though she never intended to actually have in real life. In her head these conversations are predicatble under control.

## How do others see them?
They too find her strange. Sicili accepts that this is just her sister. She is occasionally afraid to be seen with her.
Others who don't know her isn't aware of her hidden violence. They just think she is a laconic girl. Because no one perceives her as a threat they are comfortable with giving her more and more power.

## What do they feel about the gov?
She isn't aware of the level of corruption it has. She's only been here for a year or so. At the start of the story it is still the Ixan that she had dreamed of visiting and training in as a child.

## What do they feel about the church?
Hates them for displacing her family, and destroying the only place she's felt like home.

## How do they see the world?
She like Zaki sees the world as an unfair place. Instead of lashing out, she lashes in. She beats herself up for not belong in this world. There is a part of her that wants revenge on the cosmic powers that had consistently dealt her a bad hand. She won't admit that.

---
# Battle strategy

## How do they deal with conflict?
By trying to remove themselves from the situation. She struggles with interpersonal conflicts the most. For those she seem unneceesary so she throws herself into work. In may instances she hides and tries to stay out of it. 
How does she deal with external conflict, she tries to tackle them head on. But fails a lot.
One because she is afraid to user her powers.
And another because she lacks the executive functiong to make a plan.
Having constantly failing, she feels pretty worthless. Like everything she does goes to shit.

## How do they deal with lost?
AKA coping & defense mechanisms.
Why did she think it happened?
How did she react to prevent it feeling that way in the future.

**family & home**
Since was trained to serve one role, to be the head of the clan and protect her sister. When both were taken away from her, she didn't know what her purpose was for a long time. She believed what happen to her parents home was their fault for not forgiving the rival family. Yet because of her sense of duty, she tried to make it home to Atonia to avenge her family.

**The Falcon tribe** taught her that family is not just about duty. It should be about connection too. From there she found acceptance until the Order came in. For the first time she felt connected to the people she's lost. When that was over she could no longer bring herself to connect with people and ran way back to the mountain caves to live by herself for years. `TODO something brought her to Ixan, we don't know what yet.` Her way of coping was avoidance and denial... because of the guilt she felt for not being able to rescue Erik soon enough, she alleviated herself of that guilt by keeping him in her mind. 

**Lessa** made her feel alive and she can live for herself. The death of her cousin, pushed her pass the breaking point of what she can stand to lose. She won't sit idlely to wait for them to come to for Sicili, so she sets out to find her cousin's killer. When a memory ghost Lessa comes to visit her during one of the earlier chapters, she dismisses her.
V: I can't let you stay in my mind, because I need to feel the pain of you not being here, in order for me to save Sicili.
L: You want you save Sicili, but couldn't save me in time. 
V: I'm sorry. 
L: I guess, our parents pitting us against eachother meant we'll forever take eachother with caution.
V: You know that's not why!
L: Say what you want. You keep your barbarian crush around. Guess you have no one to avenge on his behalf...
V: The Order is too powerful, I'm just one girl.
L: And Roderick is just one man, when he started.


## How do they deal with change?
Change by this point in her life has been the only constant in her life. Therefore she embraces it like a safety blanket. At first she doesn't like it when it happens, but quickly adapts to it like it's a new opportunity to erase the past and the thing she thinks she had failed at.
- Protecting Sicili during the raid
- Fighting off the Order when they came to the mountain tribe

## What are her powers?
Her fugue state, summons the sorceress Aradia. 

The first time when she tuned in, she had used it to save her sister and no one got hurt. After then she wanted to harness her powers. Someone who rejects power isn't the type of woman Ace is. More than anyone she wants power, the ability make her own choices and protect her loved ones.

The second time it manifest was during a battle with her tribe, and she was trying to protect her adoptive mother. Erik ends up getting seriously hurt when she was in a trance. She now realizes that this mysterious power is too unpredictable to possess, and now hates it.
