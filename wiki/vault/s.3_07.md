# What happens
Vio & Sicili goes home to worried.

##  Why it matters
Sicili is worried sick.
Vio is completely tired.

# Consequence
Vio goes to take a shower, she thinks about what happened with Yule showing up.
And Erik appears, "so my brother finally decide to roll into town".

They talk what they had always vowed to do when they see him again for betraying his tribe.
They bounce a few venegence ideas back and forth.

Turned out by ideas of violence, they get intimate in the shower.
Vio jerks head up.

## The realization
Vio is not as anti-revenge as she appears. Deep in her heart, she sometimes does crave to hurt people who have harmed her.

## and so?
Erik comments on how real sex will feel nothing like this.
Vio says, well I wouldn't know because no one will want to have anything to do with someone like me.

Sicili announces Zaki is here to see her.
