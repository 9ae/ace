# What happens
ICED realize security has been compromised, and send a bunch of people after her. (They are in the cathedral's court yard). She first fights the first few set of them off but when overwhelmed. The prisoners get scurried away, "No!" Vio's enters pre-fugue state.

##  Why it matters
Vio has failed in her mission, she feels lost and pushes her into fugue state to make a last ditch attempt to save Halim.

# Consequence
Prisoners get sent to square. Sicili is immediatley worried about what happened to Vio.

Zaki sets in motion plan B. But something prevents him. *What?*

When the prisoners get shot a riot in the protestors break out.

Zaki gets a cut in his left cheek

## The realization
Zaki blames Edgar for perpeturating all this, and thinks as long as he is in power things like this will keep on happening.

## and so?
Zaki vows to avenge him
