# Who
*Vio* feels a little more awake. She is glad to be out of the train, because there was something awkward between Yule & Zaki. But she can't put her finger on it.
*Yule* thinks Roderick is sending him on a goose chase and just want to get this mission over with.
*Zaki* is nervous about this double mission, he keeps looking around town for the alledged convicts that have been spotted here.

# When
Around noon

# Where
Varin

# What
Zaki is asking awfully a lot of questions as they walk through the town. Otherwise we can keep the [og scene](https://github.com/9ae/ace/blob/master/chapters/05.md#arrive-at-varin).

# How
Esp. when Zaki gives the little girl all their bread. He knows too well what it's like to go hungry.

# Why
Show how sad the town of Varin is
