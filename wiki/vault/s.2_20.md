# What happens
Merge/trim [leaving home](https://github.com/9ae/ace/blob/master/chapters/02.md#leaving-home) and [bandit raid](https://github.com/9ae/ace/blob/master/chapters/02.md#raid-flashback) flashback sequences. We can take away the whole Diego bit.

##  Why it matters
Vio has been plagued with nightmares for years after all the trauma she has gone through.

# Consequence
She is riddled with fear throughout this chapter of being separated from Sicili.

## The realization
She must stay hidden in this chapter so she does not risk exposure.

## and so?
For the first 2/3 of the chapter she makes decisons based on fear.
