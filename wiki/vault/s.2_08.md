# What happens
Sicili goes to bed

Vio and Zaki stay up making a plan.

They initially plan to seek in before the public execution

##  Why it matters
Vio feels exposed, about this person she just met knowing her secret. Even Helga doesn't know.

They want this mission to be as hidden as possible, because Vio is risking alot by helping.

# Consequence
They go over a series of plans that they can try.

Use this as a world-building opportunity, show schematics and situations play out instead of them just talking.

## The realization
They realize it won't work, and the best opening is when they take the prisoners out.

## and so?
So Vio will have to do it when they release him for public execution
