# What happens

##  Why it matters
Yule knowing that the Order doesn't frequently kill captives wondes what happend to his brother and the rest of his tribe. He qustions his decision to join the Order leaving the rest of his tribe to beheld captive. 

# Consequence
*Flashback to the day the Order came:*

`Vio jumps and lands behind him with her dagger pointed at his back`
`Yule claps You are learning how to fight smart. pets Aces on her head and Erik on his shoulders Little brother, remember never let your opponent fall out of your sight.`

Erik: Guess, I'll just have to a few more eyes
Vio: You can have eyes all over, and still one small brain.
Erik: My small brain is still bigger than your courage.

`Drums sounds, and the church's calvary rolls in.`
`Tribe elders meet them up front, Yule also goes with Ace and Erik behind him.`

Church calvary 1: We are The Order of Lygeia, and we strike to bring order and peace to your lands. Join us in spirit and body to end warfare, to end suffering, to start the age in which man lives in harmony with nature and eachother.
Tribe Elder: We the Falcon tribe, are proud of our indepdence, our culture, and spirtual practices. We do not convert.
CC1: Very well then
`Cursaders grabs the elder`
Yule: Wait! He does not speak for us all.
`Erik looks at his brother shocked`
Yule: I've seen enough bloodshed, residents of these mountains are perpetually fighting.
Erik: Brother, you can't possibly.
Yule: Aren't you tired Erik? How many times did we have to relocate? How many aunts and uncles do we lose to the blade of other tribesmen? `stepping forward` Let me fight for peace in your Mission.
CC2: You have seen the light, brother.
Erik: He is not your brother!
CC1: Anyone else?
Erik: I'd rather burn in your so called Hell.
CC takes Erik and Vio, some other tribes people and slaughter the tribes people bearing arms

## The realization
Yule thinks he should have tried harder to get his brother to join his side. With them out of his sight, he doesn't know what will happen to them now.

## and so?
Goes to the archives to find out what happend to his tribesmen taken from that day.
