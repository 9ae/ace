# Who
*Alan* trying to hold back his jealousy.

# When
Start filling in the scene with a hint of green, the velvet of the gambling tables. The wait staff's forrest green and periwinkle uniforms.

# What
[Alan finds out one of Adolf's clients is Miss Galei alum](https://github.com/9ae/ace/blob/master/chapters/04.md#convo-about-struggling-weapons-industry)

# How
[Adolf finds the senator Juliette ask him to catch up with](https://github.com/9ae/ace/blob/master/chapters/04.md#convo-about-edgar-wanting-civil-war). Change Adolf's reason for talking to the senator to just that.

# Why
*Adolf* is just concentrated on doing a good job tonight.

All these scenes is good world building to show the reader the complex situation Galei is in, and help them understand no choice is a great choice.

Wow, are all of Adolf's clients racist nationalist?

# and so?
Alan was watching it all when the senator grabs Adolf in public.
