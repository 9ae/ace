Theme: When your religious institution actively goes agains the teachings of your faith, follow your faith.

*What does Vio believe in?*

*What does Zaki believe in?*

Instead of being tasked with the assignment from Roderick, Vio ask Yule for help.

Instead of something silly like a painting what if the Church in Varin houses convicts, mostly for stealing. They work with them to give them education, resources, and therapies. Give them a chance to start over. 

If we get rid of the Jacques withdraw from the gov in ch, then we can send Vio directly to Varin for recovering the convicts. Zaki ends up joining Jacques agency.

Yule is sent there to inquire about Madelaine.

Why does Vio not want Sicili to be volunteering at the church?
- a church was bombed
- Vio expanded her rage to all churches, because many still support the Order. And they killed her family.
  - Sicili explains that not all churches are supportive of The Order, and regardless of what the Order does the stuff she does in the name of faith is helping other people.

- [ ] Build up through this chapter how Vio is suppressing her feelings
- [ ] We need to build Yule's conflicts better in the previous chapters.
