## How does Vio see Sicili?

She actually was very jealous of Sicili who was able to easily make friends. Her parents also seem to be prouder of Sicili because she matched the role they had laid out for her, whereas Vio constantly failed in the obligations they laid out for her. But she was told jealous was inappropriate. So she hid it (reaction formation). The source of all her hidden power is her repressed emotions.
