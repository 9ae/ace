# Who
*Vio* walks in hoping this mission will distract how she feels about Zaki and Sicili.
*Yihan* feels disinterested. He in many ways feels like a third wheel in their dynamic. It's a feeling he had been having forever, and even expressed in it chapter 2 when Ada broke down crying.

# When
Early evening, they are preparing. The sun had set, so they turn on their lights. Their house nights are bright and white.

# Where

> When Vio walked in to the Hart's flat, it looked like a tornado sweep from their closets to the living room, shirts, hair accessories, neck ties, shoes were scattered everywhere. The siblings were no where in sight, Yi Han viciously typing away on the computation engine. "Sorry, I just need to finish setting this one thing in motion," he apologize to Vio who had just arrived.

# What

"Argh! Alan did you borrow my countouring kit again?!" yells Ada from one of their bedrooms.

"Ooops yea," Alan rushes out in a pale lavender dress shirt and pinstripe black slacks carrying a box of make-up. 

"You'd think they are just like you," starts Yihan. "But don't forget, they are just spoiled rich kids sluming it."

# How

Keep most of the [og scene](https://github.com/9ae/ace/blob/master/chapters/04.md#harts-prepping) about the plan.

# Why

Kept the heist prep minimal as to not overwhelm readers with info dump. Maybe we can go into more detail if we illustrate through it.

# and so?
"will be earning 30 grand tonight!" Ada walks into the room wearing a tight emerald dress, it split on her left tight. Her auburn hair rolled into curls that framed her cheeks. Yihan looked at her for a long moment, he noticed Alan was looking at him suspiciously, and says. "Ready team?"
