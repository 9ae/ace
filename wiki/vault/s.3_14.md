# What happens
It's a hot day in Zaki's studio, he is painting (from our perspective we can partially see it's Sicili but not fully. Maybe a lock of her hair is in frame). He is shirtless. Vio knocks, and he opens the door.
- [ ] we may have to get rid of using the same trick in ch 5

*What is their push & pull energy in this scene?*
- Vio lays down the terms and conditions. Zaki is stunned by how assertive she is about their arrangement.
She takes Zaki up on his offer, she'll help him kill Edgar if he can help her with the Order.
V: It can't just about hurting another. We must make a statement about what we will no longer tolerate under his reign.

Vio: Do you still want your justice served?
Zaki: uh.... ye... of course. Yes!

##  Why it matters
Vio does not yet see her motivation as revenge but putting an end to injustice, bringing down an institution that has caused so many harm. In that way, she can see Zaki's point a little in his desire to get back at the gov for Halim's death. So she agrees to help him, if he helps her.

Zaki is shocked by her visit, and even more so when she agreed to help.

# Consequence
Zaki agrees to help her with the Order. Though he has no idea what he is agreeing to.

## The realization
Zaki is taken off guard by Vio, and starts to develop respect for her.

## and so?
Zaki: Deal?
V: Deal! Now put on a shirt. We are going to church.
They decide to go to the cathedral.
