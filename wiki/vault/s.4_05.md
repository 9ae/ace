# Who
**Zaki** is for the first time trying to take a step towards his own happiness.
**Vio** is giddy about the possibility of a first love.

# When
Zaki and Vio both prepping, seemingly they are on the same page.
This scene starts very up beat.

# Where
Ideas:
- Bridge
- a very public place, where Vio had to react with control.

# What
Zaki is practicing what to say in front of the portrait he had just painted. We learn how much this means to him because where he's been sauve in what we've seen of him so far. He is more awkard here, it shows that he is nervous.

Vio is in front of the mirror fridgeting with her hair, this is the first time we've seen her with her hair untied. She doesn't know what to do with it. She frets with nothing other than work clothes to wear. She eventually ask Sicili to borrow a dress.

Zaki is waiting at the bridge, when he first sees Vio comes, it's a pan up from her feet, we see sparkles from Zaki's perspective. Until we see Vio's face the sparkles go away, with Vio's face all red. He is momentarily lost for words. "You... you..." (audience assumes whatever they want)

Vio: You wanted to talk to me about something?

Zaki: Ah yes... `he too turns red` it's umm I feel weird for asking you this since you've helped me so much already.

Vio: (something encouraging)

Zaki: The botanical garden has a butterfly exhibit.

Vio: Yes! The answer is yes! (impatient)

Zaki: (freezes) ... really? you'll ask Sicili if she wants to go with me.

`pans to Vio's face devoid of expression`

# How
They stand this way for a long moment, pans out. The people walking and biking on this bridge starts to look at them. Vio notices people starring.

Vio: Sicili... oh of course! I'll ask her.

Zaki: `touches Vio's arm` thank you. I'm so happy we found eachother.

`When Zaki leaves, she touches he spot he just touched`

Vio: found eachother... huh? I wish we never had.

# Why
To show my readers the feeling of being hopeful and excited about something, then having it all crumble down.

# and so?
Vio just had her hopes squashed, while Zaki is hopeful.
