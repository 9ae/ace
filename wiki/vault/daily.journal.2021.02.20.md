I think that I've been dragging my tail on this because the process feels too chaotic right now.
I am not sure how the character profiles will help, and even though doing character work is exciting. I am afraid things I've established in the character profiles will get lost.

Before I move on to Yule, I think I need to catalogue all the arc notes and scenes in one place, so I can see it all at once and know where. Just a pile of scenes and plans, from that I will be able to see what's available And know that my notes won't be lost if I add to that pile. And after the character profiles are done, I can sort through to figure out what can be used and discarded.
