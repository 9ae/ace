# Who
*Vio* feels relieved to no longer be fighting with Sicili. She also is still feeling being around Zaki, and felt relieved when Yule came and finds out he's also going to Varin.
*Zaki* is not sure why, but he feels annoyed that Yule showed up.
*Yule* wonders if he'll have to do anything this mission that will compromise his own conscience. He also is pleasantly surprised to see Vio. Less excited when she introduced him to Zaki.

# When
Early morning. The sun is super bright after all the cloulds had cleared way the previous day.

# Where
The train station

# What
While awaiting for their train Yule appears, and notices Vio. Zaki and Yule knock eyes again.

Yule ask what are they doing. Vio stumbles, and Zaki saids he's a painter, and heard Varin's church has the famous painting Prophet Rising.

# How
Yule comments on how the train is no longer on time from [og scene](https://github.com/9ae/ace/blob/master/chapters/05.md#train-station). Zaki says it hasn't been on time for years.

"What other entities are no longer under government control?" Yule ask.

'*He's fishing looking for ways The Order can undermine Galei,*` Vio notes uncertain if she should redirect the conversation. While she is not fond of the current ruling bodies, she doesn't really want to see the only place she and her sister have been able to call home in _ years fall under The Order. Before she could say anything, the train finally churns up to the platform.

# Why
This is the first mission our 3 MCs are tackling together, even if each of them has different objectives.

# and so?
They board the train, and we first see a place outside Ixan in present day.
