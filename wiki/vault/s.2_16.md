# What happens
Vio gets a message from Zaki via butterfly and meets up with him. They walk back to her apartment.

"The law may be hard, but it is the law."
"This is why Galei has the lowest crime rate. Punishment for even the smallest infraction in severe."

Zaki tells Vio about what happened to Halim. Uncertain what he should do.

##  Why it matters
Zaki battles with internal conflict on whether he should risk the org.
He goes to Vio because he had seen her fight, and knows that if it came to it she can take down many people.

Vio is reluctant to help at first, afraid it will expose her identity. She also is a little sour from Halim calling out her darkness. But she realizes that she would have risked the same for her adoptive parental figures (Yule's mom). 

# Consequence
Vio agrees to help him save his Halim. So that he doesn't have to be involved. She's a third party afterall. No one knows they know eachother.

## The realization
Zaki is grateful that Vio is helping him yet again.

## and so?
They walk up to her apartment to find hash out the details in private.
