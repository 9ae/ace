# CAUSE (what happens)
Vio and Helga camps outside the science garden to find Zaki dropping off something there when near closing time.

Helga stay behind to talk to the museums receptionist, because Vio is not good talking to strangers.

She follows [Zaki through the city](https://github.com/9ae/ace/blob/master/chapters/01.md#tails-zaki) ending up in an art suppy store.

##  Why it matters
Vio is excited they got a lead so soon, and happy to find it worked out.
She is grateful that Helga is here with her, because otherwise she'll have to ask people and gather information. Little did she know, she'll have to talk to Zaki later.

# Effect (consequence)
Deep in focus on trying to unravel the mystery of this person, she accidentally knocks over a bunch of paint balls that explode on her. Drawing Zaki's attention towards her.

## The realization
Vio is curious as she tails him through the city.

## and so?
Zaki helps out and starts talking.
Vio gets even more flustered, because she feels ill equipt to handle this situation.
