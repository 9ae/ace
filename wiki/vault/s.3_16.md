# What happens
[og scenes](https://github.com/9ae/ace/blob/master/chapters/03.md#vio-is-forced-to-work-with-yule)

*Later oh the side balcony of the cathedral. Vio & Yule talking, Zaki watching their conversation from the side.*

~~Vio: Look at you now... Grand Commander. All mighty crusader, fighting for the Order, who has killed your tribesmen.~~

Yule: Did you know the day, when you stumbled onto our carravan? We were on the move because the Eagle tribe has raided our land? The life mountain people is like that. When resources are sarced....

Vio: I know, I lived in those same mountains.

Yule: No you don't! You didn't have to watch our for anyone but yourself.

Vio: I... had companions `thinking back to her hunting pets`

Vio: When you have mothers, fathers, sisters, and children. You not only have to ensure your own survival and but theirs. And for that you'll do anything...

Ace: So what? You sold out your brother and mother... to the Order? For what?

Vio: To ensure that there will be order! One day, that the tribes can stop fighting because we'll have a greater power to answer to. A greater power to keep peace, to distribute resources evenly, to put a death to our endless tribal warfare.

Vio: And you do so by manipulating on other nations to self destruct! The Order wages war, just like everyone else.

Yule: It is not war the Order seeks but the order. You know what is scarier than tribal warfare? State warfare. If we don't unify Galei and Cella under one religious order, how soon do you think this new home country of yours will stay in peace with its neighbors?

Vio: You have not lived here long, Galei isn't just going to go to war.

Yule: A real Galei loyalist ex-pat are you? Then why don't you work for your government?

Vio: I..... can't. long pause Why do I have to choose sides, if I am not with you, doesn't mean I am against you.

Yule: No, you are right. It's more complicate than that. smiles I'm grateful to see you again. I had thought you were dead. Both you and Erik.

`Vio looks uncomfortable at the mention of Erik`

Yule: Where is Erik?

Vio: tears swells up in her eyes The last time I saw him was _ years ago.

Yule: disappointed you mean...?

Vio: Yes, after you had betrayed our tribe, they took us....


##  Why it matters
Yule needs to find out what happened to his family and Vio is the closest hint he will have to finding out what happened.

# Consequence

Flashback: Vio and Erik are in a cell

Vio: Here you can have my bread too

Erik: Are you sure, you'll need it

Vio: `shakes her head` in the mountains sometimes I went on days without a catch. My body is made for it, `lifts the bread to his mouth` yours is not.

Vio: Thanks, `takes a bite out of the loaf as Ace falls asleep on his shoulders`

Erik: I know we fought a lot, I guess I was jealous how brother had paid so much more attention to you since you've joined our tribe. Maybe it's because he saw you are going to be a much better fighter than I will ever be. Or maybe because, despite your awkward boyish antics, `blushes and looks at her, but she is fast asleep` you are really pretty.

`The door to their cell is opend by the guard, Erik jumps. Vio jumps up.`

Guard: Well.. well love birds. 

Vio stands up quickly with her arms protecting Erik

Guard: So eager to defend your little loverboy...  Where are you from?

Vio: `spits in his face`  

Guard: Bitch! `holds Vio's features up` such exotic features. I'm sure some of our captains will take pleasure in.

Erik: Let her go!

Guard knocks Erik to the floor

Vio: Erik!!!! Erik!!! `she continues to call his name as the guard takes her away`

Later we see a man who we assume is a church milita general naked, butt up laying on his stomach and the whole bed soaked in blood. Ace with her hads covered in blood, holding a fruit knife. She pockets the knife and leaves through a vent in the room.

When she makes her way back to the cells, she finds Erik had disappeared from their shared cell. She runs down the hall ways.

Vio: Erik! Erik! `she screams as she frees all the prisoners of the mountain tribes.`

*Many of them are still great fighters, and they take the guards on of the church's temporary fortress on.*

---

Vio: We stormed the fortress. Well stocked in weaponry the church's army might have been, but they were no match for mountains tribesmen, free and venegeful. War was our art, and we painted murals with the blood of our enemies.

Yule: You still see yourself a tribesmen?

Vio: I.... I have been many things. I was born heiress to warlords in Atonia. Then no one, a phantom in the mountains. You took me in, to be a proud kinsmen of the Falcons of the Mountains. Those years living with you in the mountains were the best I ever had. You made me feel accepted for the first and last time in my life.

Yule `puts a hand on her shoulders`

Vio: Now, I am simply me. Protector of my long lost sister.

Yule: Woman of many faces...

Ace: You know? I still think of him, your brother every day. I am not sure if he is still alive, but unless proven otherwise in my mind `quickly corrects herself` in my heart, he still breathes.

Yule: I know it! In my heart, Erik got out of that dungeon alive. Thank you, for fighting for my little bother.

Vio: If I had to work with the enemy, I'm glad its you. You've always been like a big brother in my heart.

Yule: Amonst the Falcons blood is irrelevant. To me you are always family.

## The realization
Yule gives into the hope that his brother is still alive.
Vio knows that if she and Yule makes up, she'll have an in with the Order and will be easier to bring them down this way. But she also realizes that Yule was just a victim of The Order's manipulation. If warlords of Atonia fell prey to Roderick, what chance does a simple mountain boy have.

## and so?
Vio & Yule decide to forgive eachother
