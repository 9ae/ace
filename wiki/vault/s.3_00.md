# What happens
[og scene](https://github.com/9ae/ace/blob/master/chapters/03.md#present-vio-and-yule-fight)

Vio goes for Yule, while he strategically defends.

##  Why it matters
Vio had been blaming Yule for betraying his tribe and taking away the only place she had ever felt at home.

Yule knows that she and any one from his tribe will react with anger. He doesn't want to hurt Vio, but he did it for the greater good. There is a bit of him that feels guilty for how things turned out.

# Consequence

Vio actually lands a few hits and injures him, because he was just trying to stop her from fighting. And since his training had always been trained to kill, just defending does not come naturally to him.

Vio talks about because of him his very own brother is gone.

## The realization
Yule finds out that his brother is "dead". Shocked and shricken he loses focus on defending.

## and so?
Vio lounges for his throat.
