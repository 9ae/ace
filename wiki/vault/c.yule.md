# At Glance

Other names: Jyri

Birthday: Jan 10

Place of Origin: The Falcon tribe of the Mountains

Job: (what do they do and how did they get started)
Chief commander in the Order

## Introduction ideas
1. square off with Vio, this is the first time we see her losing a fight
2. Catches Vio talking to a imaginary Erik
3. 

## Reader catch
As a reader, I want Yule to see open his eyes to the corrupton of the Order. I can relate to him through his morally comprosing complexity.

## Catch Phrase
- What determines something you would say a lot?
- Could be a nervous habit? When do they say it?
- What is an feeling they would express alot? "Cool beans" means 'whatever', so that's apathy.

The mountain people speak in short direct sentences (kinda like Yoda if he just said the first half of his sentences). But he changed his speech pattern after time with the Order, although he sometimes still slips back in mountain speak, when he is angry or loses patience.

What is a mountain tribe idiom he still says a lot. Something to do with the animals that live there.
What are the animals that live there? Wolves, falcons, bears.
> A bear my stand his ground when a wolf stalks, but he too will turn in the presences of a pack.

> No matter how the wind howls, the mountain will not bow to it.

# Goals

*How are they dissastisfied with their life?*
He is deeply scared by losing his loved ones to tribal warfare.
After years fighting for the Order and having raised through the ranks, he started to realize that they have brought more destruction than peace. He starts off this story by trying to convince himself that is not true. After all the Order has stopped the warlords of Atonia.

*What do they think will bring the true happiness?*
He thinks that with Galei under the Order, the rest of the world will fall under the Order because even with lower production most of the known world's weapons come from Galei. That they can fire up the old factories if any other countries does not join the Order's united nations peacefully.

*What definitive step could they take to turn their dream into a reality?*
Help The Order conquer Galei.

*How has their fear keep them from taking action already?*
N/A

*How do they feel they can accomplish their goal while steering clear of the thing they are most afraid of?*
The thinks that if he can really bring peace then his nagging conscience will shut up.
This **internal conflict** is that he knows what the Order has been doing a bastardization of the faith. But he tells himself that it is necessary.

# Arc

Means matter on the journey towards an end

Unlike Zaki who approaches things with rage, **Yule is careful planning.** What does Yule want? To end all tribal warfare by unification. Because of the Church's success in Atonia and Nuna, he really does believes that people across different cultures can united under one faith. He truly belief that it will be the unifying thread to allow people to have empathy for one another.
Think about the sociology of religion, that **having a common faith means the same moral code**, and people can more easily **trust eachother**.

*What do they believe in?*
That the Order is bringing peace to all lands united under one faith.

*What do the learn in the end?*
The Order is a power hungry sect of the church, who does not even live by their own morals at all. Roderick is really just in it to mass more power, and find his sister.

*Journey (how they learn about it)?*
- Faithful to Roderick
- ch3 we go through all the messed up stuff The Order has been doing. And how many people of the church are majorly against it, but are afraid to speak up because they get most of their funding from the Order and they have been usings this money to house and feed the poor.
- Yule is upset that Roderick will cut funding from any church who doesn't send him support in the form of soldiers.
- Yule meets Sicili, who tells him more about he faith, when she is surprised after all these years he knows so little about Lady Lygeia.
  - Yule: The soldiers leave as soon as the missionary arrive
  - Sicili givees him a book, but Yule rejects because he can't read.
  - Yule promises Sicili that next time he will act in accordance to the faith.
- Yule disobey's Roderick's orders in order to save people in Varin
- Yule comes back to Ixan, get's demoted by Roderick
- Sicili and Yule tries to get Yule's position back, by doing something that is a big win for the Order.
- Sicili gets kidnapped by the gov in their attempt
- Yule ask Roderick for help in getting Sicili back, Roderik refused.
- Yule realized Roderick only cares about power.
- Yule ask Vio and co to help with Sicili
- Yule returns to the Order only to hand in his sword and shield
- Yule tells Vio that it's time they look for their tribe.

# Backstory

~~Yule tells Ace about how they threaten his family’s village and forced them to convert.
He was the chief’s son, and was kept as hostage to make sure that their clan allied with the church.
The church took him and a few other children, who’s parents were burnt as heretics. Erik was one of them.~~


Since the org and the church are initally working together, what if Ace and Yule actually don't know eachother, and this first series is when they develop a bound. The people who found Ace were Erik's tribe, they took her in and trained her how to kill properly. They were her family for a few years, until the Church raided them, and forced them to convert. Erik and Yule were brothers, Yule converted and Erik and Ace refused and they look them away to be tortured until they convert. They look Ace away to be raped by a bishop, but of course she killed him. When she returns to their cell to rescue he was gone. She couldn't find him anywhere, and she finally escaped.

Ace's history is one of perpetual displacement and seperation from the people she cares about. When Ace and Yule meets again in chapter 3, she personally hates him for converting.

Yule is a noble heroic character subverted. While he wants to live by a good moral code, he betrays his tribe because he believes that unity will be for the greater good. Unlike most hero-types he is not single sighted and blind, the complexity of his character lies in him being able to make compromises.

His adoptive mother Benedetta, named Erik after her lost son.


*What is the best thing that happend in their life?*

# Reasons

## Motivations

Rised to be the a contender for leadership, even though his father is the chief of the tribe. His own leadership is not guarenteed, there is an expectation that he will run as leader when his father passes away. But the mountain tribes do no have inheritence leadership, and it is merit based. In their tribe, when it's time for a new leader. There is a competition, one is fighting, another is listing out deeds of one's life by a unbiased party. Every adult in the tribe casts a vote. 

In that way, both him and Ace are similiar as their were groomed for leadership. The difference is Yule willingly accepted his path, where was Ace didn't want the responsibility. They are both older siblings, and otherstand each other's pressure in that role, of having to make choices for the better well being of others.

This is why he joined in with the Church. He genuinely wants to bring peace to all nations.


## Fears

 Letting people down. He it kills him that he had to betray is tribe. But he thinks it's the best way for them to stay alive and protected. Now he see's Roderick as a father figure, and doesn't want to let him down. Even though he is starting to find his orders questionable, for not being in the interest of the people.

That all his scarifice is not worth it. 


*What do they value in life?*


## What makes them happy?
Knowing that is loved ones are safe. When people are proud of him? He responds well to words of affirmation. So much of his sense of self is wrapped in becoming a good leader, that all he wants is acknowledgement that he is/had made the right decision. He is someone who cares a lot of what other thinks about him, especially people close to him. 


## What gives them hope?
He hopes to find his brother Erik one day. And he hopes that his sacrifice by working with the church is worth it. Before he meet Sicili he was starting to lose faith in his alligence but he gives him hope because she enspouses the virtues of what Lygeian is suppose to be. 



*What makes them feel alive?*
