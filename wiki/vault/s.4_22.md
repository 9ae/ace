# Who
**Vio** reflects on her talk with Zaki.

# When
Later in the morning, Vio is back home.. trying to sleep but too excited to do so.

# Where
In Vio's bedroom, Erik shows up sitting by the edge of her bed.

# What
Erik: (saids something that transitions from Adolf & Alan)
- You think you've found your other half
Vio: `throws pillow at him` I don't make it corny that that.
Erik: You're the one with perpetual corny feelings.
Vio: I don't... it's not like that. He isn't even attractive. It's just that, I think we are one of the few people on this planet who have been through as much as we had.

Vio: I can see my own pain in his eyes.
Erik: Since when have you ever looked inside someone's eyes!

# How
A message comes from Zaki, saying he has something to tell her, and wants to meet up. 
Erik peers over her shoulders, "shoulds like he has a confession to make" and winks.
Vio: `folds the note` it's probably business related we have a deal.
Erik: `raises his eye brows` he's been seeking you out rather often lately hasn't he. Jyri told me when someone does that, they very much want to see you.
Vio blushes, "it can't be. No one ever likes me."
Erik: it will only be true if you believe it so. Why not change the tragic narrative of yourself? Give him a chance.

Vio thinks *'maybe... he may break my curse'*

# Why
We learn that Vio is a hopeless romantic, and how having always unrequited feelings had made her starved for someone to like her back.

# and so?
Vio leaves this scene hopeful.
