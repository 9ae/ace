# CAUSE (what happens)
They ask hotel staff if they had seen Zaki or checked him in. There was no record of him.

*How do they find Zaki?*
- After seeing footage of him, but unable to get a sign in record. What do they do?
- Ask Alan to get additional footage.
  - What do they see there?
  - Something Vio can tie back to the seen of a crime to make a lead.
   
**How does Vio find a record of Zaki?** How can we uses this to show how she's smart? **pattern matching**
- In one frame she notices branding of a place he frequents.
- She notices he is left handed

How does she use pattern matching to find the art supply store?
- bag
- glove

- oil paint at the scene of the crime
- she notices he has a few stains on his gloves
- and took out a bag with art depot's logo on it. She remembers Rein telling her it's a limited edition bag for regular customers.

##  Why it matters
Alan is determined to find out **who** killed Lennon.
Ada wants to find out **why** they were after him.
Vio and Helga knows that whoever killed their butler is likely also after the Harts. 

# Effect (consequence) 
Vio decides to stake out the art supply depot.

## The realization
Vio thinks if she and Helga can do a good job here, then they will get promoted. And everyone who makes fun of them will shut up. 

*If we throw the Lessa's murder storyline back in, what if they are killed the same way and Vio recognizes it?*

## and so?
