Emotion/Colors
> black, white, and grey. Intense argument between the two.

# What happens
Vio tells Zaki what happened. She feels profusely guilty for it.
Zaki sais it's ok. Zaki talks about visiting Halim's home.

Z: ... and so Edgar must now be allowed to rule.
V: Yea, he hasn't been doing things for the benefit of the country. He'll probably not stand a chance for re-election in a year.
Z: A year is too long. He must go now!
V: Do you think he has any scandals that can warrant a special trial?
Z: No, I mean Edgar von Essen will die.
`a bit ick`

##  Why it matters
Zaki must something about it. And he doesn't think he can do it alone. He needs help and weirdly, Vio is the closest person he has to a friend.

How does Vio realize he is manipulating her?
Zaki does say something similar to the pattern he used on her in chapter 1, and what she recognizes well is patterns.

# Consequence
Vio realizes it. And pushs back.
V:  I agreed to help you save someone, not kill someone.
Zaki: Why not? You kill people for a living?
Vio: This is different. Edgar didn't personally kill those people. He was just executing the law.
Without adherence to the law, what will we have? Chaos! Endless fighting! Needless death. Atonia fell to political schemes between all the various warlords. The warring mountain tribes got conquered one at at time by The Order. Galei only stands because it's territories stood united. We have a codified law, and we stick to it.
Zaki: Galei is falling apart! Can't you see that?! Yes, it once used to be steady and safe, like the shields it manufactured. But look at it now! Even in our capitial city, so many are made homeless.
Vio: That doesn't mean we should go off an assassinate leaders. Two wrongs don't make a right. I grew up in a place were we had to enforce our own justice. And violent means only leads to violent ends.
Zaki: And violent delights *smirks* I see it in your eyes when you hold a knife. *reaches out to stroke her hair*  Your heart quickens when you bring it down. 
Vio *holds her breath* what I feel..
Zaki *moves closer, and whispers in her ear* and what do you feel?
Vio *pushes him off* has nothing to do with how I choose to act.
Zaki *is a little taken by her discipline*.

## The realization
They both disagree on whether or not revenge is appropriate.
Zaki realizes that he may have to do this alone.

## and so?
Zaki: Fine, I'll do this on my own.
