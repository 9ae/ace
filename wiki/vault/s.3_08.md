# What happens
Vio tells Zaki what happened. She feels profusely guilty for it.
Zaki sais it's ok. Zaki talks about visiting Halim's home.

Z: ... and so Edgar must now be allowed to rule.
V: Yea, he hasn't been doing things for the benefit of the country. He'll probably not stand a chance for re-election in a year.
Z: A year is too long. He must go now!
V: Do you think he has any scandals that can warrant a special trial?
Z: No, I mean Edgar von Essen will die.
`a bit ick`

##  Why it matters
Zaki must something about it. And he doesn't think he can do it alone. He needs help and weirdly, Vio is the closest person he has to a friend.

How does Vio realize he is manipulating her?
Zaki does say something similar to the pattern he used on her in chapter 1, and what she recognizes well is patterns.

# Consequence
Vio realizes it. And pushs back.
V:  I agreed to help you save someone, not kill someone.
Zaki: Why not? You kill people for a living?
Vio: This is different. Edgar didn't personally kill those people. He was just executing the law.

Zaki makes a plan to kill Edgar:
He will sneak into Edgar's office, while Vio takes out any security guards.

## The realization
They both disagree on whether or not revenge is appropriate.
Zaki realizes that he may have to do this alone.

## and so?
Vio tries to stop him, and thinks the only way to do so it to pretend to go along with his plan.
