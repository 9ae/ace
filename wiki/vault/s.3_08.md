Emotion/Colors
> black, white, and grey. Intense argument between the two.

# What happens
Vio tells Zaki what happened. She feels profusely guilty for it.
Zaki saids it's ok. Zaki talks about visiting Halim's home.

Z: ... and so Edgar must now be allowed to rule.
V: Yea, he hasn't been doing things for the benefit of the country. He'll wont' not stand a chance for re-election in a year.
Z: A year is too long. He must go now!
V: Do you think he has any scandals that can warrant a special trial?
Z: No, I mean Edgar von Essen will pay for Halim's life with his.

##  Why it matters
Zaki must something about it. And he doesn't think he can do it alone. He needs help and weirdly, Vio is the closest person he has to a friend.

How does Vio realize he is manipulating her?
Zaki does say something similar to the pattern he used on her in chapter 1, and what she recognizes well is patterns.

# Consequence
Vio realizes it. And pushs back.
V:  I agreed to help you save someone, not kill someone.
Zaki: Why not? You kill people for a living.
Vio: That's different. Edgar didn't personally kill those people. He was just executing the law.
Yihan: By executing them.
Vio: True...Without adherence to the law, what will we have? Chaos! Endless fighting! Needless death. The warring mountain tribes got conquered one at at time by The Order. In Atonia where might was law, and it fell to schemes between all our warlords.

**Vio finds out The Order is responsible for all her displacement** Is this too soon?
~~Zaki: Atonia fell because the Order manipulated the warlords into killing each other off.~~ 
~~Vio: *pauses* ... what do you mean? We had always been fighting. For centuries.~~
~~Zaki: Correct, you guys had been fighting for centuries and still manage to stay a float. Yet in just a decaded all the noble house fell. How did you think that happened? And more so, who rules Atonia now?~~
**cut** this is too soon.

Vio: *eyes widen* ... the Order. But the Order can't take Galei, it can't use us against eachother. We are united. We have a codified law, and we stick to it. 
Zaki: But can't you see? Galei is falling apart! Yes, it once used to be steady and safe, like the shields it manufactured. But look at it now! Even in our capitial city, so many are made homeless.
Vio: That doesn't mean we should go off an assassinate leaders. Two wrongs don't make a right. I grew up in a place were we had to enforce our own justice. And violent means only leads to violent ends.
Zaki: And violent delights *smirks* I see it in your eyes when you held your knife against the crusader's throat. *reaches out to stroke her hair*  The hatred in your eyes, whatever he did to warrant it... it's personal... isn't it?
Vio *holds her breath* It's none of your business!
Zaki *moves closer, and whispers in her ear* 
Vio *pushes him off* 
Zaki *is a little taken by her actions*.

## The realization
They both disagree on whether or not revenge is appropriate.
Zaki realizes that he may have to do this alone.

## and so?
Zaki: Fine, I'll do this on my own.

*How do we resolve this convo without Zaki storming out?*
- ~~Zaki promises to help with Yule if he'll help with Edgar.~~
  - Nah, she wouldn't go for something that direct.
- 

Or Zaki can step away, and something make Vio want to help him.
