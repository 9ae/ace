# CAUSE

V: I... sorry
Z: Well the nice part of black is stains don't seep in.
V: *Oh no. How do I follow up?!* Haha, yea even blood dries dark. *Crap. Why did I say that?*
Z: You're the kind to frequently get into accidents, I see.
V: Yea, sometimes I'm focusing I...
Z: Lose anchor of reality `looks at her reverantly`
`They finish cleaning and stand up`

V: Yea, I got lost in figuring out... `looks around and grabs two blocks of clay`. You woudn't happen to know which I should get...
Z: `takes each the blocks and turns them in his hand` I'm a painter. But it seems this one is more malleable, and more forgiving. `hands both back to her, their fingers touch and Vio jumps in shock. The hand off is close and he smells her.`
V: Th... thank you.
Z: Ceilian lilac, a rare fragrance for perfumes.
V: I don't wear perfume. `takes a step back`
Z: `raises eyebrow` I see... `narrows eyes`

##  Why it matters
Vio faces her fear of talking to strangers by being put into a situation of having to talk to Zaki.

What is the first hint of him being suspicious? He notices she smells like a flower that is in the park he was just in.

# Effect (consequence)

Zaki probes her more to determine why she is following him.

## The realization
How? Zaki realises he is being tailed, but he is not sure why she is after him.

As they talk he realises it's the Hart's case, and manipulates her into giving critical information about the Harts.

Vio through her nervousness is not thinking clearly. And also she is a bad liar.

## and so?

Vio gets manipulated into giving critical information to Zaki.

**or we can move the rest of the convo to the next scene when Vio is describing to Helga**
