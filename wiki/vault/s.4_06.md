# Who
*Yihan* is still upset Ada didn't tell Alan about them. He also thinks what they are doing is morally question able.
*Ada* is super curious to learn more about this boy Alan seems to care so much about in such a short time.

# When
Evening

# Where
Tucked in an alley, and Ada's face tucked behind the large collars of Yihan's trench coat.

# What
They bicker about whether or not this is the right thing to do.
And segway to how Ada didn't tell Alan, and she needs to stop trying to shelter him.
"I'm his sister, if I can't protect him then what good am I?!"

Yihan expresses feelings of wanting to end their arrangement. He doesn't want to be her secret anymore. He says he actually want them to be a couple.
Ada utters they can never be a couple.
Yihan demans Why?!
Ada is silent.
Yihan "It's because I'm just an empire subject, right?"
Ada "No! you know you're one of us right? Why would you even..." turns away about to tear up. She blinks and realize Adolf is gone.

# How
They almost lost sight of when Adolf had picked up his case and left. 
Change from [og scene](https://github.com/9ae/ace/blob/master/chapters/04.md#ada-and-yihan-tails-them), where isntead of tailing a rando they just follow Adolf to Juliette.

# Why
The audience hadn't really seen them alone since Ada failed to live up to her promise.

# and so?
They eventually find Adolf had gone far yet, and catch up.
