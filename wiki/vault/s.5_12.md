# Who
*Pastor Mirka* nervous because she is harbouring known thieves. But when she sees the sheriff she calms down, since they have helped his family before. 
*Sherrif* guiltly, he knows what he is doing is wrong. But he also is at the beheast of the national law.

# When
Afternoon (2-3pm). Bright light, some clouds have came over the blue sky.

# Where
Just outside the church.

# What

`Pastor Mirka peers out the window, and turns to her people.`
Pastor: Everyone say inside, I'll deal with them. Lock all entrances, and when I walk out that front door. Lock it too.

# How
Zaki doesn't know they are the president's private security.

Sheriff: we have a warrant to search this establishment, under suspect of harbouring convicts and grand robbery.

Pastor: You know who the convicts are. One of them helped care for your children while you and your wife was were visiting your in laws last month.

Sheriff: I know, my kids love him.

Pastor: Does he really deserve to be behind bars?

Pastor explains why the convicts are and why working at her church is doing them better than being locked in a cell. She is giving them new chance, and opportunity to learn from their mistakes and become connected to the community.

# Why
Establish why the police and gov agents are here, and how the pastor at Varin has been trying to help them. Makes a case for the healing aspects of restorative justice.

# and so?
