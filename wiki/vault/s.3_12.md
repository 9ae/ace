- World
  - volunteering at a church

- relationship
  - watching old romance movies / dress rehersals of a play
    - hamlet
    - 
  - getting free samples together
  - ice-skating (in the old postal office)

# What happens
In an ice-skating rink that used to be a post office. There's a statue of Hermes. People are walking in and out jolly, with candy and beveges. Vio skates up to Sicili who is still holding on to the rails. Holding out her hand, she leads her sister into the center of the rink.

Sicili ask about Yule, Vio tells her about he was amongst the tribe that took her in.
For the first time in the series, we see Vio talk about something bad that happened to her and acknowledging the hurt she felt.

Sicili tries to frame things from Yule's side. She mentions how the order had been known to use people's weakness against them. They must have used the mountain's tribes condition to manipulate Yule into joining.

Vio ask Sicili how does she feel that the Order is using people's faith against them.

##  Why it matters
Show Sicili does trust and rely on Vio.

*How do they segway into talking about home?* "Yule was just doing what was best for his tribe. You would have done the same for Renova, if you had become head of the family."

# Consequence
They bond over the things they miss in their childhood. Renova's autumn beauty. Vio almost reflects on being a better leader than her parents. And they can do so much better for the territory now that they've lived like normal people.

## The realization
That maybe they can make a little part of the world a better place. That they can live in a state where they don't have to hide.

## and so?
Vio has hope about returning to Atonia with Sicili one day.
Sicili brings Vio to a church tomorrow.
