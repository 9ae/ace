# What happens
[og scene](https://github.com/9ae/ace/blob/master/chapters/01.md#return-to-zakis-flat)

##  Why it matters
Vio is fascinated
Zaki is relieved to be home

# Consequence
Vio helps Zaki clean up his wounds and put him to bed

## The realization
Vio has been pushed beyond what she thought her limits are in the past few days than she has in a while.
Zaki is stumped by the contradictory actions of Vio, but he is too tired to make sense of it.

## and so?
As Vio is about to leave, Zaki reaches out to pull her hand urging her to stay.
