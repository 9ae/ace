# What happens
Implied, they already told Jacques.
Jacques tells Edgar that they are still working on who is responsible. But they know why and urges him to see if he can move some funds to bring a few departments under government control again.

Edgar says no, that will show them that they have won. He will not like his citizens dictate how he should run is government.

Jacques said they technically already do, since they voted for him.

##  Why it matters
Jacques is dissapointed that his long time friend is making selfish choices.
Edgar (since he is being controlled by a council member), does not believe people he hired should have a say in executive decisions.

# Consequence
Edgar instead of bringing the housing department under the gov, hires another company to run it. And then tells Jacque his agency is a hired gun, and they have no place making suggestions as to how his government is run.


## The realization
Jacques graples with the reality that Edgar was no longer the man, he went to school with and were best friends.

## and so?
Jacques in a shakey voice says he thought they were partners. Then pulls his agents from working for Edgar.
