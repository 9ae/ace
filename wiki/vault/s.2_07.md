# What happens
Left without a detective force, Edgar rounds up registered criminals in the system as scapegoats for the bombing.

##  Why it matters
The council thinks this will knock two birds with one stone

# Consequence
Halim is one of them. ICED show up at his place to capture him.
In interrogation rooms, they  blackmail these people into a confession.
Zaki's being alive was used to blackmail Halim.

## The realization
Halim realizes that if he didn't fake his confession they might just go after Zaki and use him as a scapegoat instead. So he agrees to falsify a confession.

## and so?
5 suspects are found, says a radio broadcast. And they are to be executed publically in 2 days.
