> Why do they need to protect the Harts?

- Harts just came into town.
- They are children of diplomats.
- Ada's exhile means there are people after them.
- Who are the gov's enemies?
  - The Order secretly
  - **People's terrorist groups will want them for themselves**
    - May try to hold them for ransome and demand their parents money.
- How does the gov know that people might be eyeing for the Harts to be in their side?
  - There can be pre-existing tension between the Order & gov, where the gov thinks they are taking too much control.
  - Knows groups may try to kidnap them for ransome.


> What does Zaki's side want?
- Atonian ex-pat, 
  - What would he want?
    - Kill the Alighieri's
    - be in cohoots with the Order in hopes Roderick will re-assign Atonia under his care
- People's terrorist group
  - **Zaki can be in one of them, and they think that holding the Harts hostage will give them enough money to found a rebellion.**

Moral question of the chapter: Is it justified to hold adults for ransome, if you are using it for good?
- Ada consented to be taken for ransome after hearing their plead.
- Who planted the bomb?
  - **The gov (commands org) they know the terrorist will use the money to found their revolution. So it will be easier of the Harts die, and they can blame it on the terrorist.**
