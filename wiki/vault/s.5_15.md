# Who
*Yule* returns to the fight, hoping that his friends are ok.

# When
After having guided the people through the escape way. Yellow & orange is the color of the kitchen he runs through.

# Where
The interior of the church

# What
Yule: *please don't let it be too late* runs up the passage back to the church.

Maybe we can kill the fight from [og scene](https://github.com/9ae/ace/blob/master/chapters/05.md#vio-fugues).

Keep: Grabbing a large frying pan as a shield

# How
When he returns to the main hall, he found Vio in a fugue frenzy.

The immaculate walls of the church's main hall was dyed red. The blood of task force, the blood of the Varin police, and the blood Pastor Mirka, all of it stain Vio's hands. Zaki hid behind a piano.

"Vio?" Yule calls out gently as he walks up to her. She looks up at him, her pupils gone, and glaring up at him in her shiny white eyes, he could almost see his own reflection. Just as it looks she is about to attack him, he reaches out for her, and flings her knife away with the frying pan. He reaches out and embrances her.

He takes her hands in his, he'll have to ask for a new pair of white gloves when he gets back. "It's okay, the battle's over." Her grey irises slowly fade back in.

# Why
To show the bound the two have and how he really is her adoptive older brother, able to calm her tantrums.

# and so?
The readers now the immense terror of Vio's powers.
