# What happens
As Vio and Zaki walk out of his Halim's home.

Zaki reflects on how he probably should have said these things to Halim. He tells Vio how Halim took him from the streets when he was living there after his parents died.

Vio reflects how Halim treated Zaki like a son, and is sure he'll forgive him if he just apologizes.

##  Why it matters
Zaki feels guilty for saying mean things to Halim.

# Consequence
There's pass few blocks of homeless people near a cathedral being built. Zaki mentions how this used to be a tentament block before the land was sold off to The Order.

Then there's a lot of ICED sirens and it turns out that a building got bombed.

It's a private company that took over the department of housing.

Vio gets a page from Jacques.

## The realization
Vio realizes how Galei's struggling government is affecting its citizens.

## and so?
The two part ways.
