Emotion/Colors
> Light Vio&Zaki as the villians in this scene. Black, white, dark green.

- What do we want to show with Zaki & the executioner?
  - Is it a quick kill? Does the monologue?

# What happens
Man just strolling down an alley. He is visibly scared.
It appears Zaki has been following him. He runs.
Vio jumps down blocking his path, with two knives held out.
He takes out his hand gun, Vio throws a dagger, cutting off his hand.
Zaki catches up, "don't worry, you won't needing it any more". With a syringe he presses it into the executioner's neck.

##  Why it matters
Zaki goes into this with anger, a sense of self righteousness
Vio knows this is wrong, but she also knows it must be done

# Consequence
Zaki tucks a piece of paper into the man's pocket, and slices his throat.
When ICED investigates they will know someone wants justice for the public executions.

## The realization
The purpose of this scene is to paint to the the audience our protagonist as villians.
Zaki feels the rush of satisfaction. But then becomes re-traumtized from watching Halim die.

## and so?
Flashback to red of watching Halim die, eyes wide opened.
Vio nudges him back, "we have to go!"
