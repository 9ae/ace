# Who
*pastor Mirka* who is very of visitors. It's a small town and she knows everyone. So everyone she doesn't know is suspicious, they don't get out of visitors, and she is housing convicts, so she is worried about government spy.

# When
Grey, classic blue, and b&w with hard lines

# Where
Varin church, when the first enter. We see "The Prophet Rising" on the right wall. Zoom into to see it's magnificent and creepiness.

# What
Keep the first half of the [og scene](https://github.com/9ae/ace/blob/master/chapters/05.md#varin-church). With the pastor being suspicious. When Havel shows up Zaki recognize him as one of the convicts.

# How
Cut out the talk about the painting.

## Yule inquires about Madelaine.
"Pastor," Yule says. "I was wondering, is the nun who purchased this piece still working with you here?"

"No, I'm afraid she is no longer with us," she says mournfully.

The sounds of something loud breaking on the other end shocks Yule's ear with the earpiece. Vio turns to look at him with a questioning look. "Just high altitude headache," he says. "What happened to her, pastor?"

Vio wonders why Roderick is trying to find someone who has been missing for decdes.

Zaki notices that almost all the convicts on the list are here, and also what seems like crates of food. And silently presses the button the agent gave him

# Why

Zaki sets the  climax in action.

# and so?
The local sheriff and his men come to re-arrest the convicts.
