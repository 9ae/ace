# CAUSE (what happens)
Vio gives the print to Alan. Ada & Yihan is also there.

- [ ] Replace Helga with Alan

Vio recounts to Alan how she got Zaki's finger print.

`Vio lifts tape from a finger print on the clay and gives it to Alan.`
V: Tada!
A: Wow thanks. And you are sure it's him? 
V: Unless wearing glasses in the nighttime is a new trend. Then again, I'm vastly unaware of trends.
Ada: It's not. I think he's our guy.
A: `typing into a machine` I think we have a match...
According to records, he's dead...`turns the screen to show Vio Zaki's file`
(Assumed dead; wanted for potential murder of his parents.)

Then someone attacks them.

##  Why it matters
Vio is proud and excited going into this scene. She had an okay time talking to a stranger, and even got his finger print. Something about that interaction made her heart beat quicken, but wasn't exactly sure why.

# Effect (consequence)
They find Zaki is supposed dead, or has forged his own death. They become more suspicious of who he is now.

## The realization
The mystery of who killed Lennon and why has explained. They have many more questions:
1. Who is this suspect that is supposed to be a dead man?
2. What did he want with their butler?

## and so?

Then someone attacks them.
