# Who
**Zaki** is excited
**Sicili** agreed to give it a try.

# When
Around noon

# Where
The botanical garden, butterfly conservatory.

# What
Zaki stumped for words when Sicili comes. Zaki's internal dialog shows just how much he idealizes her.
*What do they talk about?*
Zaki asks her about her time with at church.

Zaki: Vio tells me you are a school teacher at a church
Sicili: Yes. I love working with children, and with the Order running around. It's good to have a place to remind them faith is more than conquest. Do you go to church?
Zaki: No.

`they are silent for a moment, until they walk to the next exhibit`

Zaki tells her a lot about the differen species of butterflies.

# How
He asks her a few questions, she answers them flatly. But he reads more into them  than she intended

# Why
Date falls flat, but Zaki thinks it went great.
We also see how Zaki had very little chemistry with Sicili, or it might be because he's too nervous so he wasn't able to employ his usual charms.

We want Zaki to be relatable in his scene with how badly he messes up when you are in the presence of someone you like, and how you sometimes become a dud. Because you want them to like you that you are too afraid to show your true personality in fear of rejection. So you just agree to everything.

# and so?
Zaki goes home feeling hopeful.
Sicili leaves, reluctant to tell Vio that she doesn't really think they click.
