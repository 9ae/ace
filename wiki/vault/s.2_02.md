# What happens
After parting ways Zaki goes to his org. He apologizes for messing the mission up. 

##  Why it matters
Zaki enters their HQ scared, and uncertain if they will keep him around.
We find out more about what this org is fighting for. That is they are against the privatizaiton of more government sectors because the companies that take them over only care about the profits and not the people.

The kidnapping of the Harts was so they can have capital to buy some sectors from the gov and look out for the interest of its citizens.

# Consequence
The leader saids it's ok, but next time he mess up they will kick him out.
Zaki promises that he won't because being part of this cause is important to him.

## The realization
Zaki feel a little scared.

## and so?
Zaki promises he won't mess up again.
