# What happens
They go to the cathedral to find Yule, for what Zaki thinks is to kill him.

Do they get stopped guards?

Vio: I am here to see who goes by Yule!
G1: What business do you have with the Grand Commander?
Vio: Tell him Vio wants to talk.
G1: You can't just...
Vio shows him a pendant belonging to the falcon tribe.
G2: You're his lost tribemen, he's been looking for them for years.

##  Why it matters
Vio is nervous but determined.
Zaki thinks that he's finally won her over in seeing this his way.

# Consequence
The G2 goes to fetch Yule while G1 assorts them to a terrance.

## The realization
We get a better tour of the granduer of this cathedral.

## and so?
Yule comes out to greet them, he's wry since the last time he saw Vio she tried to kill him.
With one hand holding his shield and another on the tilt of his sword, ready to unsheeve if need be.
