# What happens
Zaki takes Vio to visit his mentor, who thought him to use butterfly toxins. He's another Hastuit.

Halim specializes in sleep potions, and can give her something to ensure dreamless sleep.

##  Why it matters
Zaki wants to help Vio, since she saved his life.

# Consequence
Halim looks at Vio and in one glance assumes she is his girlfriend. "Nice he finally has someone to challenge his persumptions. He can get too set in his beliefs, taking the everyone else must conform to his morals."

Vio blushes. Zaki corrects him said they just meet last night.

Halim ask her about the nature of her nightmares. Then places his palms on Vio's temples and closing his eyes, after a few seconds jumps back as if stricken by a jolt. "Such darkness buried deep. Such unnatural power entwined in your very being." Shaking his head, "I'm not sure if there's any remedy for that."

## The realization
Zaki is curious to what his mentor mean by her power, but also uspet at Halim for not being helpful.
Vio becomes even more assured that she is too fucked up to be fixed.

## and so?
Halim just sends them off with some chamomille and lavendar oil.
Zaki left saying very mean things to Halim. We see Halim looking dejected when they leave.
