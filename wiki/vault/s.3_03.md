# What happens
[OG notes](https://github.com/9ae/ace/blob/master/chapters/03.md#erik-and-yule-hunting-scene)

##  Why it matters
The purpose of this scene is to connect Yule to a character we already know. And show what his life once was like living with the mountain tribes.

- [] We need to extend it to make it more chaotic. To really show the chaos of war.

# Consequence

## The realization

## and so?
