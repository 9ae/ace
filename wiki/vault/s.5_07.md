Keep none of the dialog from [og scene](https://github.com/9ae/ace/blob/master/chapters/05.md#sicili-and-vio-make-up) since it no longer applies.

# Who
*Vio* and *Sicili* are both apologethic

# When
Around sunset high constrast. After the rain has stopped, magneta and vermillion. Google "sunset after rainstorm" for references.

# Where
Bump into eachother while returning home. They walk up the stairs together.

# What
Vio and Sicili both apologize.

# How
They reach a better understanding and consideration of eachother's perspective.
Vio acknowledges that the help Sicili does is important, and even though the chruches have to funnel money back to the order. She is not the one doing so, and her helping has value in itself.

Sicili understands her rage athe the Order, especially since it displaced her twice.

Vio says she'll make sure to never let that happen again.

# Why
To show how Yule has pushed Sicili; and Zaki Vio to understand beyond their limits.

# and so?
The sisters make up, we can move on to the larger plots of this chapter.
