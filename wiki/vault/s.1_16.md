# What happens
*How does she prep herself up for talking to people?*
Ask for Sicili's help.

*How does she recognize that is what she needs to do?*
She looks around, the ICED is there. She tells herself they are just like her. She prepares the questions ahead, of time and anticipates their answers and follow up questions. They aren't that helpful, so she has to talk to hotel staff after she notices something (the scent of a flower the sleep butterflies likes).

##  Why it matters
She is panicked when she realizes there was a break in and the scene has been tampered with.
She is nervous about having to ask around, but knows that is the only way she can rescue them.

# Consequence
Talks to the hotel staff and they give her a lead.

## The realization
Vio can overcome her fear of talking to strangers if she just preps up. Vio must grit up.

## and so?
Vio has a suspicion of where the Harts and Helga are taken to.
