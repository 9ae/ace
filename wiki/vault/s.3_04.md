# What happens
Instead of going home Zaki goes to Halim's place, he has a key to his apartment. Halim gave it to him because he wants him to always want him to feel like he'll always have **sanctuary** in his home.
Zaki goes to Halim's apartment and cries.

##  Why it matters
Zaki is unable to comprehend what just happened.

# Consequence
*What do we show in Halim's apartment to retrigger the flashback?*


## The realization

## and so?
This new reality (without Halim) is hard for him, he goes back to the first moments they meet.
