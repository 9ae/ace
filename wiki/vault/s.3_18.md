# What happens
In the Hart's flat, it's just Alan and Adolf.
Alan comes back with a tub of icecream to the room wearing a fuzzy robe, while Adolf is just in bed sheets.
Adolf is looking around the room at Alan's mechanic parts thrown everywhere. "Are you in the weapons industry?"
Alan laughs, "No, this is just a hobby. Well, violinist-escort what else do you do?"
"That's it, I don't have the connections to land me a spot in the philharmonic. "I'm just a poor boy from an dysfunc factory town."
"Is the country-side that bad? I heard about the country's economic troubles but..."
"It's been a slow decline for as long as I've been alive. We used to be something, where all workers's children are guaranteed a good education. But was more and more nations around us are united under the Order, things started going away. When I was seven yeras old, our schools could no longer afford to hire music teacher. Since they didn't think it will ever returned, we all got to keep whatever instrument we were learning that year."
"And you continued playing?"
Adolf nods, "I practiced on my own. My family lived next to a young man from Ivonne. When he would practice his violin, I listened and tried to replicate the songs he played. And for a few years that was how I learned more advance songs."
"Did he noticed you were resonating him playing?"
"Eventually, he came to my house one day"

FB: A man in his early twenties, and Adolf when he's 14. "I might be going insane, but sometimes I hear the songs I play coming from your home."

"It turns out he used to be a music student, but returned home to take care of his aging mother. He agreed to actually teach me, but I couldn't really pay for the lessons... so I traded something else."

##  Why it matters
Alan stunned, he couldn't imagine what that must have been like. How much do you love something if you are willing to sell your body for it?

Adolf was shocked that Alan wants to know so much about him. All his other clients want to pretend Adolf is someone else. No one has ever asked questions about himself before. They barely even call him by his own name.

# Consequence
Alan ask if being a violinist is his dream. Adolf says yes, but he also write his own songs too. And for the most part prefers to play them, but he earns more money playing overs. Because people are often drawn to something almost forgotten but still familiar from their memories.

Alan says he'll love to hear Adolf play his songs sometime.

When Adolf leaves, and Alan reaches his to pay him, Adolf refuses.

## The realization
Their relationship transformed from business to potentially personal.

## and so?
Adolf is touched that Alan is interested in him as a person.
Alan is excited to find someone who likes him. He hasn't had the best luck in love. He is feeling so lucky to have found someone so fast.
