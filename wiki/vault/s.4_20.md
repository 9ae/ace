# Who
*Ada* is patching up her wounds.
*Yihan* realized part of his motivation to want Ada to tell Alan was a test to see if she will choose him over her brother. But he realized that doesn't matter. She cares about him, and that is independent of how much she loves her brother.

# When
The next morning

# Where
At their flat, somewhere not the kitchen. Maybe Ada's room?

# What
Yihan knocks on Ada's open door. "Can I help you with that?" Ada is wearing just a bra, cleaning the wound on her ribs. She nods for him to come in.
Yihan kneels in front of her vanity table, apologizing as he helps her. And explaining why it doesn't matter any more.

# How
Ada: He's my brother, we are bounded in spirit. `motions to her pendent`
Yihan: And you are the best sister. `he is finished cleaning her wound and slowly stands up but stop midway as Ada's lips meet his`

# Why
Resolve Yihan and Ada's differences for now

# and so?
They see Adolf leave. Ada goes to checkin on Alan
