Change the rando to Adolf from [og scene](https://github.com/9ae/ace/blob/master/chapters/04.md#finds-juliette).

# Who
*Yihan* is even more upset.
*Ada* is riddled over guilt for what she can't tell him. The truth is she does indeed really like him abd she knows for sure if she tells him, he'll go away.

# When
A hour before showtime

# Where
Into an opera house in old town.

# What
- [ ] Really show the architecture of old own

Ada: *If, only he knew how his brother dead... If he knew he won't look at me anymore. I don't want to lose him.* (say this in a more poetic and philosophical way). Sometimes the truth comes at a great cost. And I'm not ready for that lost.

# How

Adolf: Madame..

Juliette: `turns around` Gorgious! `her eyes wide and happy to see Adolf`. What a beautiful glow you've got! Got off from a pleasant John? `winks`

Adolf: Haha no, actually I've seeing someone.

Juliette: You don't say... Well I'll love to hear about who put that smile on your face. But you are probably not here to gossip.

Adolf: Oh, yes. Who are the people you want me to talk to this Saturday?

Juliette `opens her pocket book and takes out a list`. Here, this is for you. Remember (important figure) is back in town, be sure to catch up with him. He's been asking me about you last month when you back in your home town.

Adolf: You can trust me to be on it.

Juliettes: Thanks you really are my best boy.

`Adolf air kisses her on the cheeks and leave`

**This can be what they steal from Juliette to blackmail her. Her clients will not be happy if that list was released.**

# Why

We want to show an ambiable relation between Adolf and Juliette. Especially Juliette being like a mother to him. This will help tell the audience why what they are doing is wrong.

# and so?
Ada & Yihan decides to try to get Juliette's pocket book.
