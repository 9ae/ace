chemistry is basically just an energetic exchange between people.

- Bring together likely characters.
  - Vio & Zaki are both assassins. They are both loners
- dynamic. push & pull. tango
- challenges eachother, raise the stakes. power struggle.
> For example, the best banter always includes moments of surprise. The banter rolls on pretty much as expected—an instinctive script of classic responses—until suddenly one of the characters no longer fits the expected role. She says something unexpected, and the entire dynamic shifts. The other character is forced to adapt a new response.
- How do they change eachother?
- opposite ends of a theme
  -  How does their conflict with eachother move the plot
