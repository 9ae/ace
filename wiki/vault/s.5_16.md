# Who
*Vio* feel awkward asking for Zaki for help, because she is not comfortable asking for help in general.
*Zaki* is still in a pretty good mood, thinking he and Sicili has a chance.

# When
Around sunset

# Where
Vio visits Zaki
Zaki's studio, the sun is just setting we see super dramatic clouds. He is not shirtless, but still somehow sexy. He leans on the door frame with one arm above his head and other on his waist, greets her in a low voice.

# What
Vio is standing on the top of the spiral stairs infront of Zaki's flat talking to Erik.
Vio: Maybe I shouldn't... he voided our deal.
Erik: He did promise to help you nonetheless.
Vio: Maybe he was just being polite and he didn't mean it. You know people are...
*too many times, I've taken people's words for real when they don't mean to*
Erik: Could be, but this is too big of promise to make casually. You are talking about taking down a multi-national religious order.
Vio: Exactly, who would agree to that for real.

Zaki opens the door and sees just Vio standing outside. Vio jumps. 
He is hair is dripping from a shower, wearing a undershirt tank.

Zaki: Oh it's you. I thought I heard something.
Vio: *suttering* Sorry... I oh... uh.

# How
Now inside Zaki's apartment. The primary light source in the sunset which shines pink and purple upon them. Vio summons up the courage to ask Zaki to go to Varin for with her. Zaki agrees and ask what's in Varin.

Use this scene to show the dynamic when solving problems together.

Zaki ask if Sicili would be interested in a second date. Vio ask does it mean it went well. Zaki saids he thinks so, and lookings dreamily out the sunset. Vio knowing otherwise smiles and says she's glad and thinks they can be happy together. Then she looks away with down cast eyes.

# Why

To show how much Vio is repressing her feelings

# and so?
