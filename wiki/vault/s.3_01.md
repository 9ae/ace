# What happens
"Vio!" Sicili calls out.

- Sicili and Yule sees eachother for the first time, they didn't talk
- Yule & Zaki's eyes meet and they are show with the diagonal antagonistic panelling.

##  Why it matters
If Sicili hadn't come in time, Vio would have killed Yule.

# Consequence
Vio backs off, not wanting to have her sister watch her murder.

## The realization
Zaki sees Vio's rage in this fight, and will use it against her later.

## and so?
Sicili and Yule lock eyes, and recognize eachother when they talk for the first time in the confession booth.
