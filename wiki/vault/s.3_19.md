Emotion/Colors
> Red & black (their hairs). Sexy, bonding, into almost cheezy romance. 

# What happens
*How do we set the scene?*
They are hooking up in the org's office because Alan is home. On Alan's chair because he was the biggest one. 

Yihan begs Ada to be his girlfriend during sex.

##  Why it matters
Yihan actually has a crush on Ada, and wants to take her out on date.
Ada and Yihan started hooking up right after his brother's death. Yihan trying to ignore the fear and grief. Ada trying to ignore all her guilt about killing is brother and endangering the entire rebellion. While she is kinda charmed by Yihan, she doesn't see this as a thing that will last. Or they can ever be a real couple, especially since she killed his brother. So she doesn't want to risk Alan getting upset over this fling.

# Consequence
Afterwards, she as him if he meant what said earlier.
Yihan says, it wasn't a in the moment thing and he really meant it. He would like them to come out and be a real couple.
"We are in this beautiful city, we should enjoy it together. Out."
"No locked in a underground facility? They say Ixan's tunnels are almost as large as it's surface."
"No, I want us to see the stars."

They sneak into the rooftop of the building they are under. We see the stars and almost an aerial view of Ixan.

## The realization
Their fling is getting real. 

## and so?
Ada bites on the internal conflict of whether or not to tell Alan.
