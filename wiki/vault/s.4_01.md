# Who
**Alan** and **Adolf** both feel incredibly lucky, at the start of this scene. Grateful to have found someone.

# When
Morning, soft blue. pastel colors

# Where
The sun rose too early, every day for Alan, especially today. He did not want to leave the comfort of his bed and his company into the brisk autumn morning. Alan let his fingers slide through Adolf's blond tresses. When he leaned in to kiss him, Adolf's lashes fluttered ticking Alan's cheek. Adolf followed the tickles with a light peck, and slowly opened his eyes. They caught each other's lazy hazy eyes.

# What
Adolf turned slightly away, and whispers "I have morning breathe".

"I don't care," declared Alan as he leaned in for a kiss. At that moment, all of Adolf's masks returned to their unstructured clay forms. For so long, he had not been intimate with someone, where he didn't have to play a role. Where he did not have to put on a form of perfect reflection of someone's desire. Alan had wanted him, morning breathe and all.

"I wish our times together weren't so time boxed and fleeting," muses Adolf.

"What about this weekend, we take the train to Ivonne? Instead of playing for others, we listen to others play for us. Maybe we can even get you a new violin ~~, since the town is is known for the craftsmanship of string instruments.~~ (too info dumpy)" suggest Alan.

"I would love to, but I have to work this Saturday." says Adolf.

Alan looks disappointed, and a small part of him tingled in jealousy knowing that "work" meant that Adolf will be in the the arms of other men or women.

"Hey," says Adolf as he brushes Alans bangs away from his eyes. trying to cheer him up. "We have now," he pressed himself into Alan fiercely, and Alan gripped Adolf back as if he was the edge of a tower. 

# How
Alan is jealous of Adolf's line of work. And wants to get him out of it, convincing himself that is what Adolf will want too.

# Why
We see them sweet, probably the first sweet scene we have seen the whole series. Convince the audience these two really belong together.

# and so?
