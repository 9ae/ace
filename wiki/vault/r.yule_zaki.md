# Dynamic
They are aesthetically opposites. Yule is willing to sacrifice his own soul if he can make the world a better place. Zaki is willing to sacrifice the world to make himself feel justified. 

**don't make this about Sicili** even if they are both competeting for Sicili to return their affection.
If Sicili had liked them both then it will make sense for them to get along. But it's more of a line than triangle.

# History

## How did they meet?
They first met when their eyes crossed in chapter 3 in the cathedral's courtyard. They did not speak one world to eachother.

What was Zaki's impresssion of Yule there?
It was someone Vio was fighting. He registered how much she hated this man. So he assumed that Yule is bad. And since he didn't have Vio's history with him, he never quiet changed his mind about Yule.
Zaki can't comprehend how Vio can want to kill him one day, and apologize the next.

Yule's impression of Zaki?
When Sicili got Vio to stop attacking him, Yule was out of breathe. From his shield he saw Zaki, standing there in his trenchcoat. Or during their first meeting, while Vio & Yule are fighting. Zaki found a dagger on the ground and threw a him. And it's a combination of that and Sicili calling for Vio that made her stopped. Yule marked Zaki as dishonorable when they first met.

## Formutive experience they gone through together


# Perspectives

Prejudices: dishonorable.

## How does Zaki see Yule?
Prejudices: suspicious, thinks Vio let him go too easily. Zaki is someone who stands by other Hastuit, and is disgusted when Vio told him what happened and how he betrayed his tribe.

## How does their opinions of eachother change over time?
