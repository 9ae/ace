# Describe your set-up.

![[s.1_00]]
![[s.1_01]]
![[s.1_02]]
![[s.1_03]]

# Describe your inciting incident.
> In one paragraph, describe the event that causes your protagonist to begin their adventure. Think: "The moment everything changed was when..."

# List events in your rising action.
> Write a list of five (or more) events that build up to the climax of your novel. These are the steps that take your protagonist farther and farther away from their ordinary life, on the journey to get what they want. Keep increasing the conflict little by little. Throw obstacles in their way! Give them some hard choices to make! Add supporting characters to help! 

*How do we bring Zaki into the mix?*

If we want a good forgiveness story, what goes wrong? Who needs to forgive who? And why do they do it?
- Alan & Ada - reinforce their strong bond?
- Vio & Helga - Helga gets blackmailed because someone threatens to expose her
- Alan & Yihan - already a tense relationship. And it's not obvious they need to be together.
- Helga & Ada - they already started off on the wrong foot, so it's a huge leap of faith for them to trust in eachother.
