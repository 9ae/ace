# List events in your rising action.

*How do we bring Zaki into the mix?*

If we want a good forgiveness story, what goes wrong? Who needs to forgive who? And why do they do it?
- Alan & Ada - reinforce their strong bond?
- Vio & Helga - Helga gets blackmailed because someone threatens to expose her
- Alan & Yihan - already a tense relationship. And it's not obvious they need to be together.
- Helga & Ada - they already started off on the wrong foot, so it's a huge leap of faith for them to trust in eachother.

*What is the type of story I wan to tell in this chapter?*
*What needs to happen for this to be an engaging pilot?*
- We need to show the very relatable sides of Vio.
- We want to see her fight again. We also want to show Helga fight.
- Show an touching example of forgiveness being used

- [] What is Zaki's plan to:
1. Lure information about the Harts out of Vio
2. Make her think the danger is X
3. But set up to push the Harts towards Y, where he'll be waiting.
4. How did Zaki get them ensnared?
   1. they go back to the Lennon's hotel room, where Zaki is waiting.

```
Z: Really? The fortress, I heard they are in the pockets of x.
V: Oh no.
Z: Try _, much more secure
V: Oh why thank you.
```
Can be about the place or a type of lock.

*What is the point of this?*
To show how easily Vio is deceived. Maybe instead of her Zaki using her twice. She first takes his advice. But **Ada will still need to get mad at her** and threaten to tell.
Then **it is when she goes over her convo with Erik does she realize the Harts may be in danger**

*What is it that will make Ada particularily upset?*
Maybe they just get placed in tigher security. And during Helga's watchm she realized she had exposed them more to Zaki.
