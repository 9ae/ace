*How do we bring Zaki into the mix?*

If we want a good forgiveness story, what goes wrong? Who needs to forgive who? And why do they do it?
- Alan & Ada - reinforce their strong bond?
- Vio & Helga - Helga gets blackmailed because someone threatens to expose her
- Alan & Yihan - already a tense relationship. And it's not obvious they need to be together.
- Helga & Ada - they already started off on the wrong foot, so it's a huge leap of faith for them to trust in eachother.

*What is the type of story I wan to tell in this chapter?*
*What needs to happen for this to be an engaging pilot?*
- We need to show the very relatable sides of Vio.
- We want to see her fight again. We also want to show Helga fight.
- Show an touching example of forgiveness being used
