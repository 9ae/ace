# Goals

**Treat this as a short story**
- Inciting incident
- Work through conflict
- Learn from conflict
- Apply learning
- Hope (lead into the next chapter)

Think about this as a showcase, put your best foot forward.
This should be a microsm of the entire first book.

Must have:
- Vio & Zaki starting out in opposition to eachother
- Finding common ground towards the end

**Inciting incident for book 1 that gets psuedo resolved**

What are Vio's CTAs?
- To defend Sicili
  - Lessa's murder
- Risk of being uprooted again

## Plotting
Draw the link from the first scene (Vio murdering 12 people in cold blood) to last scene (Vio rescuing Zaki even though he did a horrible thing).
- Zaki did something to trigger Vio's CTA.
- Zaki's reason for doing X is related to his greater plot of wanting revenge for his parents death.. too much tragic back story?
- Vio finds it is Zaki who did it
- But decides to forgive him because _.

## Questions

### Starting questions
- What does it mean to have faith in a time when your religious institutions are corrupt?
- What does it mean to forgive and not forget?
- What are the internal changes and external acceptences for forgivenss to be complete?
- 

### Ending question
- When is forgiveness the incorrect choice? Can you over-forgive? When is revenge justified?
- Are you forgiving for imagine or genuine forgiveness?

## Themes
Forgiveness and faith

## Character
1. Strong character intros
2. Showcase Vio as an autistic girl
   1. living without awareness of her problems
   2. resources to help her survive
3. Bring Zaki into the story

## Scene
- I am very good at setting cinematic scenes
- dark & whimiscle tone
