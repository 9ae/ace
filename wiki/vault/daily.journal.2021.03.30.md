> Who hired Zaki to kill Lessa?

Obviously someone, who wanted Aligheri dead.

> Why is Zaki working for them?

It seems like there's a few storylines that are dropped mid way.
That probably isn't great for stringing the reader along.
How do we make Zaki's decision meaningful?

Will we need to prompt him up a lot this chapter to show how much revenge means for him?

In his chapter we have to show why he wants revenge for X.
Ok... let's work backwards. We know he is part of a citizens group. Do we even need Lessa's storyline?
What is the point of Lessa death? To test what lengths Vio will go to in her forgiveness. And we already have that for Sicili being held hostage. Maybe we can keep Lessa as a character, and she is in Shanghai.

So what did Zaki give up? I guess just on his revenge quest.

> How does falling for Sicili makes him give up on his revenge quest?

Let's say Zaki wants revenge for his parents death. Then he would be after the people who came to his house that night.
At the start of the story he is still on that path.
How does that intersect with the sisters?

> How do we explore venegence in this chapter?

Zaki for his family
Zaki for Hastuit

Vio's flashback to the start of displacement. Here we also dive deeper on why Vio & Sicili advocates for forgiveness.

... we can push back on his giving on on the revenge quest until after his date with Sicili in chapter 4 so we may have more breathing room for Vio to convert Zaki over.

We dive deeper into why Zaki is part of this citizens uprising. 

> What they are protesting against?

Privatization of government services has caused many people to be homeless and taken advantage of. None have it worst than the Hastuit. 

> What are their goals?


> Why does Jacques breaks his contract with Edgar?
