# What happens
After the day's events Zaki saids: Today, I meet the girl of my dreams.

> Early evening, Zaki looks outside his attic windows, one of his hands held his other wrist behind his back. His clothes look a little lattered, and the is a fresh cut on his right cheek. "I just met the girl of my dreams."

##  Why it matters
This scene provides complexity to Zaki's decisions from this point on

# Consequence
Mislead reader, while all cueing points to Vio.

## The realization
Logically it is Sicili.

## and so?
Everything since will be influenced by his infatuation for Sicili.
