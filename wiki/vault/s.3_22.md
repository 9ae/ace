# Who
**Vio** had just watch Zaki kill someone
**Zaki** is shoken, he is trembling as Vio leads him through the alleys.

# When
In the middle of the night, right before midnight.

# Where
She brings him up to a roof top to hide from above.
The hidden passages of Ixan, they accidentally end up on the street Zaki's parents used to live in.

# What
Zaki goes into a dark place, just reliving all his trauma. He talks about the night his parents died. [og scene](https://github.com/9ae/ace/blob/master/chapters/03.md#raid-on-zakis-childhood-home)

# How
Z: I don't know how to live when every step I take, the turn just punches me back.
V: *I feel that too, wasn't aware anyone else felt the same.* `nods` The world is a violent place, find whatever bit of peace you have and perserve it at all cost. *He may be the only one who can understand... my own darkness*
Z: Where is the light, with every tragedy the darkness grows. It'll consume me one day, until sorrow is all I know, and hatred is all I am.
V: No matter how dark my world gets, I know my sister needs me. She needs me to stay sane, she needs me to protect her.
Z: Right...

# Why
Vio falls for Zaki's darkness.
Zaki is remined of the hope he felt when he meet Sicili, a flashback to his painting of her (maybe another portion).

# and so?
Zaki finds hope in Sicili.
Scene pans out in what is typical of a rom-com ending just without the kiss.
