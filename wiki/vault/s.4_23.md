# Who
*Alan* is confused, lost. Uncertain what he did wrong.
*Ada* is ready to comfort Alan, knowing just what he needs.

# When
peach & pink

# What
After he turned Adolf click the front door shut, Alan sinks to the floor in a puddle of tears. What has he done?!

# How
Ada comes into his room with a large slice of blueberry cheesecake. "Yihan saids it might not be time to take you to _  yet. But maybe a preview will keep your hopes up."

Alan shivers, "he left. He could have been my first love."

"He may still be," says Ada as he cries into his sisters arms.

# Why
To actually show how the Harts are constantly there for eachother through every heart break.
