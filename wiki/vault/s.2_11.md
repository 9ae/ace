# What happens
When he tried to get them involved in helping rescue Halim, they refuse.
Z: Isn't that the point of our organization to help people like him?
O: The purpose of our org is to fight for the greater welfare of our citizens.

##  Why it matters
Zaki knows that they have the resources to rescue those wrongfully acused. 

# Consequence
They are actually responsible for the bombing so they tell him to lay low and not par-take in the execution protest. All give have agreed to say they were working out of their own volition. So that it doesn't connect them back to the org. If they were to get caught rescuing them, then it will jeopardize their cause.

They urge Zaki to not try anything if the wants to stay with them. It would jeorpardize their whole operation, and doesn't the greater good mean more than the lives for five men?

## The realization
Zaki starts to feel disillusioned with the org.

## and so?
Zaki is conflicted, nods and walks away.
