Zaki caught off guard had no idea what came over him. He panics goes pathetically, ah ah while shakingly tries to move.
"The vemon of the _ butterfly paralizes in less than a second," Halim says as he slowly walks up to Zaki.
"Enough time to turn the _thug_ into a _trick_", Halim takes his wallet back and gets Zaki's knife.
"Nice, made by _. Oh there factory used to be just a few hours away. Unfortunately they are no longer around since the dessert nations agreed to a peace treatise."

##  Why it matters

"Wait, Sir. What was that?"
