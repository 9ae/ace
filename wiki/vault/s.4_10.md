[og scene](https://github.com/9ae/ace/blob/master/chapters/04.md#vio-gets-summoned-to-mission), because they suspect she must have body guards

# Who
**Vio** is trying to not think or ask about Sicili's date.
**Sicili** is emotionally drained from the awkward date.

# When
Same night

# Where
The sister's kitchen

# What
Vio is reparing something at home. Sicili tells them the date was super awkward. Vio suggest giving it another try before outright rejecting him.

# How
Helga gives them a call asking Vio's help for the Harts.

Sicili divulges important information about Juliette.

> "Lessa worked for her." Sicili answers casually. "We used to go over to her house during the holidays. Since we had no other family, she treated us like her family. In some ways, she was more of a mother to us than our mother had been."

> "Oh," she turns her attention back to the broken vent. Unable to shake off the tight feeling in her stomach. She was going to help blackmail a pimp who was been there for her family when she couldn't be. Would she had said no to helping if she had known? She can't wait to meet the lady who temporary held her place, while she struggled through the desserts and mountains to reunite with her sister and cousin. It wasn't hard for any woman to be a better mother than theirs. She was too busy running the family business to get to know her own daughters. One year when Vio won first place in the regional co-ed martial arts championship, her mother ordered a cake that read "Congratulations Sicili!" Is she about to take down the only woman who was kind to the Alighieri girls?

# Why
To show Sicili's side and feelings about the date.
How the sisters are living super low key, and Vio is the "man of the hosue".

# and so?
Once again hinting that Juliette is pretty good person.
