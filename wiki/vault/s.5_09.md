# Who
*Vio* goes to sleep because she's normally asleep during the morning
*Zaki* suspicious
*Yule* suspicious

# When
Morning. Grey, brown, dark green.

# Where
Train.

Yule chose a set of seats near that group; Vio and Zaki joins him. In five minutes the conductor welcomes the new passengers a broard. He mutters a string of stops a head, that they couldn't make out through the static of the speakers. A whistle blows outside when they finally depart from the station. Leaving the city behind, the clock tower and the cathedral fades. Four story dwellings turn into old warehouses, and then into barns. As the roll through the golden wheat fields, Vio falls a sleep. Her head tilts to rest on Yule's shoulders.

# What
Left alone and without much of an introduction the two stare awkardly at eachother first. Yule finally breaks the silence. 

Yule: So, why are you headed to Varin. Not like it's a vacation down, it's nothing there but dysfunc factories?

Zaki: Yes, dysfunc factories. Is that where you are hiding your weapons. (snide)

Yule: No, I'm simply just looking for someone.

Zaki: Us too (returns to stare outside the window).

Yule: (catches the hint that Zaki doesn't want to chat)

- [ ] Zaki starts another conversation...

# How

Vio wakes up and the executive squad shows up, but they don't know it's them yet.

- [ ] Yule mentions that he meet her sister yesterday. Zaki tenses up.

# Why
Establish a dynamic between Yule & Zaki

# and so?
