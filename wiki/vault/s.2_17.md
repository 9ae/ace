# What happens
They return home to find Sicili.

Vio and Zaki talk about the protest, and how Zaki will be in the crowd, while Vio tries to rescue Halim before they take him to the stage.

Sicili heard about the protest and wants to participate.

##  Why it matters
Zaki becomes instantly infatuated with Sicili.
Vio does not want Sicili to particpate afraid it may be dangerous.

# Consequence
Vio and Sicili argue over it.

Sicili brings up the fact that she is putting herself at risk. And since she is illegal if she gets caught, they'll be separated again. And yet she is still taking that risk, guess they are both taking risks today.

There's an awkward moment because no one outside of their family knows.

**readers also don't know until this point**

## The realization
Zaki convince Vio to let Sicili be in it, he'll be there with her if anything goes wrong.

## and so?
Vio agress, and ask him to signal her if anything goes wrong.
