# What happens
Jacques debriefs them on what happened. The office building belonging to a company that runs a few of the government branches got bombed.

Vio points out that Helga is injured and doesn't feel confident enough yet to go on an investigation mission on her own.
Jacques tells her to not worry, she'll get new partners.

##  Why it matters
Jacques is serious in tone.
Vio is worried because her usual partner Helga is injured from their last mission. And the rest of the org picks on her.

# Consequence
Jacques says Ada and Yihan will be assigned to work with Vio.

## The realization
Vio realizes they are not just charges, actual memembers of her agency.

## and so?
They start with the protestors who are against privatization.
