# CAUSE (what happens)
Vio research butterflies since they suspect butterfly poison was used. Frame turned to a page on butterflies with sleep toxins.

##  Why it matters
Vio feels nervous, and guilty. She is determined to fix things by gaining more knowledge of the situation, because she also finds comfort in facts. She wants to gain more knowledge of the weapon her opponent uses.

# Effect (consequence) 
She makes notes of all the toxins he may have used on the butler. None of them seem directly like the answer.

## The realization
She suspects the killer must have mixed toxins.

## and so?
While researching her mind wanders back to the conversation she had with Zaki.
