Summary

# Plot A: Vio & Yule working our their differences
Now that we undersand what the world is like. How does the Order coming in change our view?
We can initially present them as a savior, and Vio is one trying to convince people they aren'ts as good they seem.
**theme: Not being believed**

# Plot B: Zaki spending more time with the sisters

# Plot C: Alan & Adolf seeing eachother more frequently

Seems like we can interview B & C's themes together.
