# Goal
Get readers to fall in love with the idea of Vio & Zaki. While showing Vio falling of Zaki in this chapter.

- *What makes people fall in love?*
  - *What made you fell for R hard and fast?*
    - The assurance that you two alone can understand eachother's darkness. Accepting shame.
      - finishing eachother's thoughts. Vio showing understanding towards Zaki's anger.
      - Zaki bringing out Vio's denied desire to seek venegence.
      - sharing eachother's dreams. They both had been displaced at a young age. They just want to be in a living situation where they don't have to hide. (Both work in the dark arts.)
    - Sudden pursuit. Vio never had anyone like her. Zaki's intimacy makes her heart flutter, even if she didn't like him at first.
      - Zaki too hadn't had much romantic action. They are both a little involve with the idea of having a partner.

Through helping Zaki get venegence and Vio's Order stuff, they work together and the audience has chances to see them interact and buy into their dynamic.

Summary

Vio & Yule working our their differences
Now that we undersand what the world is like. How does the Order coming in change our view?

   2. They kill the executioner. Zaki found out he was a single dad, and just orphaned his children. He had done to those kids what was done to him.
2. Vio learns The Order is responsible for Atonia.It's took away every place she called home. Now they are here, she won't let that happen to Galei. They go to find Yule, to do what Zaki thought was to finish her fight with him. But instead she apologizes for attacking.
