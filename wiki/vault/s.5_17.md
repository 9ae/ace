# Who
*Pastor* feels betrayed by the sheriff
*Sheriff* feels shame but determined because Edgar promises that if he can arrest the convicts for him then, he'll relocate him and his family to a position in Ixan.

# When
Blue, green, orange.

# Where
Outside surrounding the police and the President's security force are men and women of Varin, each bearing some very sharp items of their own. But from the way they held them, Yule is not sure they all know how to properly use the every weapons they make.

# What

Pastor: Why are you helping them? You a resident of this town should know why you can't lead them in here. You who have not been paid in a month, have been bringing your wife and children to our soup kitchens.

Sheriff: executive orders. The President himself called. And turns out he can back pay me and my men and then some more. Something the citizens of Varin can no longer do.

Pastor: That's what this all about?! Someone throws you a treat and you betray your own people?

Sheriff: Hmm this town. Well, I'm done with this town. If I can do this for him, he has a post for me in the city. Finally I can leave this rotting hell hole *spits on the ground* Plus have to look out for my own.

`A woman with an infant strapped to her back, cleaver in one hand and butcher knife in the other yells.`

Woman: You were elected to look out for all the people of this town. You've turned a blind eye to the convicts. You who as Pastor Mikra has described has benefitted from them their help yourself.

Sheriff: Does not change a fact they are thieves, and belong in jail.

# How
`A thin frail old man comes forward, looking up from his glasses.`

old man: Civil disobedience. It is not a crime, to violate the laws on an unjust system. It is our moral obligation. 

a boy: If you must arrest the new church volunteers, arrest me too. I helped them rob the freight trains.

another man: me too

woman: Our town jail has twelve cells; see if you can contain us all. Officer my  guts. You're no officer, you've ceased to be our sheriff the moment you stopped protecting us.

# Why
civil disobidience as moral obligation for unjust systems and alws

# and so?
The whole down raises up against the sheriff
