She had always looked up to him. He was the first person who said they believed in her abilities. At first she had a crush on him too. But he eventually got a girlfriend, and she gave up on him. She considers him as more of an older brother now. He has always saw her as a little sister, he had hoped that she'll be a good match for Erik because she kept him in check.

archetypes: Yule is the hero, while Vio is the anti-hero. He tries to make the world a better place, while she just wants to keep her family safe. 

the change arc is how his spirit for trying your hardest influenced her to step into the spotlight and take charge and help out.

She helped him let go of the guilt for abandoning his tribe. Or did Sicli do that? It would matter more if she did it because she is the one he needs forgiveness from (well also his family, but they aren't here). 
Vio is also the only one he knew as Jyri, he gets to be his old self with her.
