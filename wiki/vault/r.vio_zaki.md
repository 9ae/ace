Their relation arc is a like a valley arc (what other call flat arc). It gets a bad rep for being called flat. Because in through the character returns to the truth with a greater understanding of it and the lie. The insight they have gained should not be discounted for. 

She is his foil. While he is a mix of MPDB and broody bad boy, how has Vio influence him. She loves whole heartedly. While she may not be his dream girl like Sicili, Vio was the first girl to ever show any interest in him. And even though he never intented to, he shows her a certain degree of vunerability because he doesn't care that much if she will stop liking him. 

He sees **Vio** as the path to get to Sicili. But he ultimately ends up being confused because in many times she breaks his mold that he had set out for her. Well what is that mold? That she's depraved and broken? Her hands are stained with blood, both from his own and Ada's doing she shows greater kindness and bravery than he understood. Vio is a very contradictory character, and filled with internal struggle. **She challenges the way he perceives people.**

They both find eachother a mystery.

~*~

What if their arc is shows they have chemistry. After they get into quiet a few near death situations together, she too falls under the thrill of being together. Though less than Zaki, because she is always in near death situations. But Zaki is pursuing your sister. It's like when your crush likes your best friend instead. That makes Vio a much more active character in this triangle. 
Examples: early seasons Willow.

*How are they similar?* both are seeking peace after their traumatic childhoods. They both want justice for the death of a loved one.

*Where do they diverge?* Vio wants to forget, where Zaki wants retribution.

Well she seems to have develop a crush on him. How did that happen? Since she's unaware it has to with her need more than her want. She needs to fight for what she believes in and accept her powers. Zaki does exactly that, he fights for what he believes in (even if she disagrees with his motivtes). He owns up to his abilities, though his isn't as deadly as hers. We have to show a scene where Zaki is willing to give up control for a greater good.
