# When

# Where
Into the men's bathroom

# What
[og scene](https://github.com/9ae/ace/blob/master/chapters/04.md#alan-gets-jealous)

# How
Alan holds his pendant towards the bathroom mirror and checks in with Ada. Ada reflection shows up, she brings the fan (it has one side that is a mirrored surface) to her face. "Are you alright?"
Alan: yea. (Alan recognizes her anxious expression) Are you?! `he ask quizically`
Ada: Yea. Only 10 thousand more to go.
Yihan: Great, we are counting on you.
`Ada nods and turns off the communicator`

# Why
Shows more of Ada and Alan's intimacy at being able to recognize something is wrong.

# and so?
Ada becomes worried seeing her brother's break his wine glass. It makes her anxious to win so she can just get to her brother. Instead she starts losing.
