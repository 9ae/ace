# Who
*Zaki* is excited for his first mission at the agency.

# When
Next morning

# Where
Zaki is at the train station before anyone arrives

# What
After buying tickets, an agent comes up to him.

[Agent tells Zaki](https://github.com/9ae/ace/blob/master/chapters/05.md#gov-agent-visist-zaki) there's a few convicts that went missing a few weeks ago after a bank heist. They were last spotted in the town of Varin.

# How
He gives Zaki a button Zaki gets a buzzer button that is suppose to alert gov agents if they find the convicts.

# Why

*Why does Zaki agree?*
- He knows that Zaki had been hunting down those who killed his parents, and can get him the last man.
- **The agent knows who had set Halim up to take the fall.**

Brings the characters to collide with Yule's mission.
Time away gives us a chance to see our MC interact more directly with eachother and in a more collaborative setting.

# and so?
They decide to take the train to Varin the next day.
Or it can be the afternoon of the same day, since we don't need to wait of Zaki's reply.
