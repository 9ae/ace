# Who
*Vio* goes to work early in the morning angry.
*Zaki* is excited for his first mission at the agency.

# When
Later in the same morning

# Where
The agency

# What
Jacques saids there's a few convicts that went missing a few weeks ago after a bank heist. They were last spotted in the town of Varin.
Jacques sends Vio & Zaki to recover convicts.

# How
Jacques ask Zaki to stay after Vio leaves. He gives him a button, and says there is a chance Vio may not have the what it takes to get his job done. But he's gonna test Zaki if he will. Zaki gets a buzzer button that is suppose to alert gov agents.

# Why
Brings the characters to collide with Yule's mission.
Time away gives us a chance to see our MC interact more directly with eachother and in a more collaborative setting.

# and so?
They decide to take the train to Varin the next day.
Or it can be the afternoon of the same day, since we don't need to wait of Zaki's reply.
