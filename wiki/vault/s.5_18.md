# Who
*Vio* is at awed by the bravery of the town's folk to stand up to authority.
*Yule* is inspired by their bravery.

# When
After watching the townsfolks stand up to the sheriff.
Shades of blue grey and white yellow light shining through the windows and stained glass

# Where
Inside the chruch

# What
Start with [og scene](https://github.com/9ae/ace/blob/master/chapters/05.md#yule-helps-volunteers-at-the-church-escape)

Vio: anhki... `squezzes Yule's hands` I've never seen anything...

Roderick: Excuse yourself. Now is the chance to make your escape.

Yule: `jumps in shock and whispers` Yes, I know what I have to do `he unclips the earpiece, mic, and camera from his body. Placing them on the floor, with one gentle step crushes them under his boot. He turns to the people of the church.`
Brothers and sisters of our faith, before they turn their attention to us. This town needs you and your dedication to serve its people. I can guided you to safety.

Disciple 1: There's a tunnels.

Yule: `nods` yes, let's go. `turns to Vio` how long could you hold them off if they come in?

Vio: I can take them. We've faced scarier warrior tribes together that those before, right brother? `winks`

# How

Yule brings the people in the church to the tunnel while Vio and Zaki hold off.

By the time, they found the entrance to the secret passage, they could hear loud shattering of glass and smell burning oak. 

# Why

We need to show that Yule has learned his lesson from Sicili about chosing what Lygeia would have done.

# and so?
Yule goes with them through the passage.
