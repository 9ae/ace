# What happens
Next day, Vio is watching to hijack the transport from jail to the execution square. Yule sees her from a Catherdral balcony, and we see her jump from his perspective.

Zaki & Sicili are at the protest.

Vio goes jumps on top of the transport, and sneaks in the cargo.

##  Why it matters

# Consequence
If they fail or get caught they'll be dead too.

## The realization


## and so?
