# Who
**Vio** disappointed from her talk with Zaki, tells herself there's more important things to focus on.
She tells herself love is sacrifice.
**Helga** is excited to see her since she's been recovering.

# When
Around the same time in the evening. The glow of the street nights are green. Shows Vio's repressed emotion

# Where
West end of Ixan.

# What
Vio walks to visit Helga. Erik is following along.

Vio: They say love is sacrifice right?
Erik: Wow just this morning you weren't even sure about this guy, and now you say you love him?
Vio: No, I mean Sicili. I want her to be happy, and he's *smiles*
Erik: Are you actually smitten with him or just the idea that someone might like you?
Vio: It doesn't matter! He doesn't like me. It's my sister he wants, just like everyone does.
Afterall, I've got a whole religious institution to bring down. I don't have time for love. `opens the door to Helga's building and slams it in his face`

# How
Vio is faced with the decision of trying to bring down the Order, she is talking to Helga about it.
Helga suggest that if she can get all the churches to break free of the Order, then it will lose it's power. Vio rejects that idea, because she does not think she has the power to convince anyone.
Helga: It doesn't matter what you believe in yourself neither. You must for Galei. **Vio repeats this back to Ada during their prep talk**

# Why
We push Vio towards facing one of the things that makes her scared. We learn about her insecurities and where they are rooted from.

# and so?
Vio decides to put Zaki out of her mind and focus on her mission.
