# CAUSE (what happens)

Vio walks home near dawn. Nervous about what to tell Sicili if she gets fired. Erik joins in.

After being all flustered by her encounter she runs through their conversation in her mind. Erik makes a comment how she always does that. She saids she needs to analyze every social situation to understand what actually happend.
E: Isn't it tedious?
V: I don't talk to people much, so everyone is important.

##  Why it matters

Vio needs to process social interactions by playing them in her head. She was so overwhelmed from meeting Zaki, then finding out who he is. And having to tell the Harts. She runs off and screams and cries, and we start to see her about to enter fugue state. But Erik comes in and holds her back.

# Effect (consequence)

E: You are overwhelmed, I know. But stay here with me, will you?
V: I failed her again.
E: Who?
V: Sicili, I'll get fired. Then we'll have to go elsewhere. How am I suppose to be a big sister, if I can't even... why am I like this? Why can't I be normal like everyone else.
E: `brings her into his shoulder as she cries`
`zooms out to see her crying on a guard rail`
V: Where did I go wrong?
Flashes back to the conversation she had with Zaki.

## The realization

While trying to process what happend with Erik, she realizes that the Harts are still in more danger.

## and so?

She goes to find them, but it's too late. Vio calls Helga but there's no answer. But go to rescue the Harts.
