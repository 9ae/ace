**Highlight the opposition between the faith and the religion.**
Are there weird protestants and catholitics vibes? Is this too Irish?

- *How does Vio find out?*
  - *Through what method would be most heart breaking?*
    - Give her hope of returning to Atonia, maybe in previous convo with Sicili.
- *Who tells her?*
  - ICED officer mentions it on the way side. "The Order is a dieases. They ingited tensions between the Atonian warlords to bring down the whole penisula."

# What happens
Vio joins Sicili in volunteering at a church.

*What if instead of ICED comes, the crusaders do. They say now all churchs must fall in line with the Order.* Originally the church was used to house the homeless, and now the order wants to use it for training.

##  Why it matters
Vio starts the day with hope, and willingless to let go of her anger towards Yule. She is even thinking about apologizing to Yule later.

With the crusader raid, she becomes more angry at the Order.

# Consequence
CC: ... just like how His Holiness made the city states of Atonia fall.

## The realization
Vio realized that the attack on her family's wasn't just normal rivalry warfare. It was fanned and stoked by Roderick.

## and so?
Vio redirects her anger towards Yule towards The Order instead. Since Yule couldn't have been responsible for her initial displacement. But the order definetely had its hand in making both of her homes go away.

Vio vows to bring the order down, they should no longer be allowed to tear apart people. They say they bring peace, but themselves enable more war.
