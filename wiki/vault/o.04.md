Plot A: Alan tries to free Adolf from his contract
Plot B: Vio/Zaki/Sicili drama
Plot C: Yihan is upset Ada can't come forward to Alan

**Goal** Show Alan & Ada's co-depencies
**Goal** Maybe look at previous chapters to see if we are setting up Vio & Zaki's arc correctly.

Should we add Yule in here? **Vio** did decide to bring the Order down in last chapter. 
- [] *What is her first motion towards that?*
