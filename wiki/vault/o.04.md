Plot A: Alan tries to free Adolf from his contract
Plot B: Vio/Zaki/Sicili drama
Plot C: Yihan is upset Ada can't come forward to Alan

**Goal** Show Alan & Ada's co-depencies

Should we add Yule in here? **Vio** did decide to bring the Order down in last chapter. 
*What is her first motion towards that?*
This will be her first battle chapter, or have her prepare for it.
How will Vio prepare for standing against The Order? What fear must she overcome?
Last chapter we learned about how she was trained to become a leader. And in the previous chapters we learned about her lack of social skills. She never thought that she could be a good leader for her family, something in this chapter challenges her in that.

What if Vio was the one who ends up convincing Juliette to let void Adolf of his contract?
