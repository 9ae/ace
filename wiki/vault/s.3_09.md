Vio goes at it with a punching bag.

Vio reflects on her own hatred and how see is tempted into venegenece.
Is she a hypocrit for wanting it?

# Consequence
"Jyri accepted me for who I am."
"With that falcon tribe, I had felt more at home than with my own family."

Flashback to happy times when she lived with the falcon tribe

## The realization
That Jyri had also took away the only place she felt at home from her.

## and so?
It seems she is not resolute in going after Jyri.
