# Who
**Ada** just decided that her brother is too important to lose, and risked her relationship with Yihan. She is a little scared.

**Vio** feels a sense of resolve, from having settled things with Yule. She is also alittle blushy because she thinks she is falling for Zaki.

**Zaki** is excited. He wants to find out who pulled the trigger on Halim.

# When
Night (around 8pm). Dark blue.

# Where
Their office at the org. Ada typing on a large machine while Vio & Zaki watches from behind.
Vio asking a lot of questions about how Ada writes the algorithms.

# What
Ada: So I wrote a facial recognition algorithm against the government badges of people who are work as executioners, against the picture Zaki drew. `shows them a profile on the screen` and I think we have a match.

Vio: Thanks

Ada: Why did you want to find him?

Vio freezes, *how do I justify what I'm about to do?*

# How

Zaki: We think he may be taking money from the triads.

Ada: Oh wow, I didn't know guards in Galei can be bribed.

Zaki: Our nobleness was a myth of a bygone era.

# Why

Ada asking them provides them an opportunity to try to justify their faulty reasoning.

# and so?
They head off to find the guard who executed Halim.
