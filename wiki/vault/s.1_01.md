# CAUSE (what happens)
After her job, Vio walks home in her bloody clothes. Erik joins her along the way and the two of them talk. We see the streets of Ixan. When they reach the door, she talks him for walking with her. We find out he is a figment of her imagination.

`TODO Who is still out at this hour?`

`TODO What do they talk about?`
- current events in Ixan
- working for the org
- her life in Ixan
- *What will show us most who she is?*
  - Erik comments about how she should find a cleaner job. Vio says killing is the only thing she is good at. Everything else will involve too much talking for her taste.
  - Forgiveness
  - Her longing for romantic attachment. He essentially is her imaginary boyfriend.
    - E: You should find someone real.
    - V: Why? When you are so perfect in my mind?
    - E: Because you have been wanting for someone. I am just filling in that need, you've made me to fill in that need.
    - V: No one real would want me.

##  Why it matters
Establish Vio as a potentially unreliable narrator. She is someone who has imaginary friends. Vio has trouble processing the world she lives in. And through imagined scenarios, she makes sense of it all. Also establish her as someone who is haunted by and very much lives in the past.

The purpose of this scene is to connect her to introspective readers. 

# Effect (consequence)
Vio is someone who sets herself up for rejection.

## The realization
Vio is not all there

## and so?
Readers should look at her skeptically
