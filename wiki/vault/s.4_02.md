# Who
**Alan** feels disappointed Adolf has to leave.
**Adolf** is worried about being late to meet Juilette
**Ada** is nosy about her brother's new flame.
**Yihan** is trying to surpress his anger about how Ada keeps on putting Alan's feelings before his desires. I guess he too is jealous.

# When
```
By the time they parted bodies, it was almost noon. "Fuck!" Adolf panics, "I'm suppose to meet my madame!"

"You have a pimp?" Alan raises an eyebrow.

"My madame looks after me," Adolf corrects. "She sends people to watch over me when I'm out on the streets."

"So she can count your patrons and knows how much of a cut she deserves." Alan theorizes.

Adolf ignores his comment, focused on getting dressed. Alan continues, "you know. I know string quartets. You can be playing the violin full-time?"

"I'm also content with playing the flute part time," Adolf winks. "Especially when I get to play with you." He kisses Alan and heads out Alan's room. Unfortunately, the kitchen was not empty.
```
# Where
The Hart's flat

# What
[og scene](https://github.com/9ae/ace/blob/master/chapters/04.md#adolf-meets-ada-and-yihan)

Adolf walks into the living room with Yihan sounding dissapointed. They notice him and quickly switch their conversation to be about cooking.

Ada tries to get to know Adolf better, are registering that who her brother has been seeing.

# How
Adolf excuses himself to leave. Alan comes into the kitchen

```
"Afraid you sister is scared you new boyfriend away?" teases Yihan.

Alan sighed, "she always does."

"Only the best, are deserving of my genius brother." Ada confirms. "Pay back for burning every love letter from my locker."

"Those were chumps," Alan says. "You'll be Lady Wickshire, they'll never be a suitable match. Ma would have never approved, I was just trying to spare you heartache."

"Ma was just racist," Ada says.

"Exactly, think about how she'll react if she found you she are sliding down with a Chundu subject," Alan exclaims.

Yihan flinched at what Alan had said. *'Is that why she won't tell Alan? Her parents don't think I won't be worthy of her.'*

Alan goes to help Yihan clean up, and looks up "curry"?
```

(back to go scene)

# Why

Show how Alan and Ada seem to be spetick of eachother's romantic involvements. And also explain why it was so hard for Ada to tell Alan about Yihan.

# and so?
Alan asks their help in observing Adolf in one of his shifts.
