Roderick through his ear piece ask Yule what is going on.

Yule: I think it's the president's special force. Well, I suppose if we face them now we won't have to later. `draws ot his sword`

Roderick: No! Don't that's all the guards he has. You are my best soldier, but don't think you'll even stand a chance again them. They are trained to defend, just to kill anything that gets in their way. You are too valuable to lose, you are like a son to me.

Yule: `her skipped a beat on the last sentence` Then, what do you suppose I do?

Roderick: I've been to this church many years ago. I know's a secret tunnel behind the meters in the cellar.  It should lead you into town.

Yule: What about everyone else? There's people working in this church? If the force is as you say they are, everyone will be slaughtered.

Roderick: They'll be the perfect distraction for the police and force when they break into the church. Your castrating assassin friend, should hold them off long enough for you make your escape. `Yule pictures Roderick smiling at the other end` Let their chaos be our salvation.

Yule: I don't know if I can...? It's not what Lady Lygeia would do,

Roderick: My mother is dead. I don't want you dead too. Please, The Order needs you alive. I need you by my side.
