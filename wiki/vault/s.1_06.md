# Cause
What is their lead? The hotel he was staying at.
They go to his room to find him dead, lips purple.

##  Why it matters
Ada and Alan were excited to see their butler, Lennon, after being separated for years.
Finding him murdered  was severly traumatizing for Alan who was basically brought up by him. And he has a much lower tolerance for violence.

# Effect
Determined to find the murderer, Alan hacks into the hotel's security system.

They find Zaki visiting the butler.
"Isn't it weird for someone to be wearing sunglasses at night?" When he doesn't appear to be blind.

## The realization
Vio and Helga sees how they are a great addition to the org.
Ada starts to get nervous that someone is after them and worried she can't protect Alan and Yihan.

## and so?
What do they do after finding footage of Zaki?
