# CAUSE (what happens)
When Vio comes home Sicili has breakfast ready. The morning news on the radio talks about:
- The Harts coming in town, famed hackers, children of foreign nobility.
- More attacks by citizen groups on officials and business owners.
- Mafia men found dead, and it seems the castrating assassin is at it again. Sicili eyes Vio. "You ought to be more conventional. We shouldn't be drawing too much attention to ourselves. Remember we are here illegally."
V: Does it matter how they die?
S: It does if it's usually violent. Homicides are rare in Galei, even rarer if it's this bloodly. Why not try poison?
V: Poisons are for ladies...
