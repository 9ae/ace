# CAUSE (what happens)
They go to meet the Harts. We first meet Alan running up the hill in preppy clothes.
We go into the flat, where boxes are being unpacked. We see some monster truck equitment.

Yihan and Ada are hooking up in one of the rooms, when they hear Alan calling for them.

Vio - Alan: Alan makes Vio laugh. He makes her feel seen.

Vio - Ada: They both are older sisters. Something about their too similiar personalities makes them **clash**.

Vio - Yihan: Vio can't put her finger on why, but she doesn't trust Yihan. He seems too smooth of a talker. 

Helga - Alan: Alan is happy to meet another queer person so soon in Galei. He knows Galei is queer friendly. Helga feels comfortable with him, in that she didn't think he looked at her like a freak.

Helga - Ada: Ada makes a sly remark about Helg'a size. She eyes Helga up and down, "yea sure I feel protected." Helga thinks Ada is a spoiled brat. 

Helga - Yihan: Yihan gives her smirk smile, and Helga blushes. *at what point during the convo does this happen?*

*What conflict arise at the end of this scene?* **raising the stakes**
- got a death threat
