The sun rose too early, every day for Alan, especially today. He did not want to leave the comfort of his bed and his company into the brisk autumn morning. Alan let his fingers slide through Adolf's blond tresses. When he leaned in to kiss him, Adolf's lashes fluttered ticking Alan's cheek. Adolf followed the tickles with a light peck, and slowly opened his eyes. They caught each other's lazy hazy eyes.

Adolf turned slightly away, and whispers "I have morning breathe".

"I don't care," declared Alan as he leaned in for a kiss. At that moment, all of Adolf's masks returned to their unstructured clay forms. For so long, he had not been intimate with someone, where he didn't have to play a role. Where he did not have to put on a form of perfect reflection of someone's desire. Alan had wanted him, morning breathe and all. He pressed himself into Alan fiercely, and Alan gripped Adolf back as if he was the edge of a tower. 



By the time they parted bodies, it was almost noon. "Fuck!" Adolf panics, "I'm suppose to meet my madame!"

"You have a pimp?" Alan raises an eyebrow.

"My madame looks after me," Adolf corrects. "She sends people to watch over me when I'm out on the streets."

"So she can count your patrons and knows how much of a cut she deserves." Alan theorizes.

Adolf ignores his comment, focused on getting dressed. Alan continues, "you know. I know string quartets. You can be playing the violin full-time?"

"I'm also content with playing the flute part time," Adolf winks. "Especially when I get to play with you." He kisses Alan and heads out Alan's room. Unfortunately, the kitchen was not empty.

A girl with red hair, and a boy with black hair and glasses were debating the proper ways to make tofu curry. The black haired boy looked at Adolf confused, but his companion smiled and introduced herself. "Hey I see you've kept my brother in late. Did you have fun?" She said with a rethorical wink.

Adolf blushed, well at least she wasn't his wife, as he initially suspected. He definitely had such awkward run ins, especially with the older wealthy men. He wondered which one was worst, finding out your husband has a mistress, or finding out he has a call boy.

"Would you like to stay for lunch?" She offered.

"We can't guarantee it will be good, as you see we are trying something experimental...." explains the boy with black hair.

"Thanks, but I gotta go." Adolf hurried out the door.

A few minutes after Adolf left, Alan went out into the kitchen. "What were you doing?!" he asked Ada, "I heard you back there."

"Afraid you sister is scared you new boyfriend away?" teased Yihan.

Alan sighed, "she always does."

"Only the best, are deserving of my genius brother." Ada confirms as she pinches Alan's cheek. "Curry?"

"like Nana used to make it?" Alan curiously peaked into the pot.

"Not exactly..." Yi Han admitted.

> More time in this scene to show three of their interactions with eachother

"You want me to tail someone?" ask Vio. She and Zaki are in the Hart's dining room. After the failure of tofu curry, Ada and Yi Han went out to pick up pizza. 

 

"Well more like follow a people trail," explains Alan. "They may call be Galei's greatest hacker, but I know nil about field work. And there's not much I can gather with someone's who so... off-the-grid."



"Sure," says Zaki. "Who do you want us to stalk?"



---



"Alan said we should be looking for someone watching the violin boy." Zaki declares. Vio nods, scanning the low traffic commercial neighborhood. They were a few buildings away from where the street violinist had setup. Tucked in an alley, and her face tucked behind   the large collars of Zaki's trench coat.

She was had a knack for finding patterns. Everyone going about their day, had a rhythm within them. Those that didn't must be doing something out of the ordinary. But the enchanting draw of the violinist's strings had made it difficult for her to focus. 

"Do you think.." starts Zaki. Vio put her finger to his lips. "Oh, you know that's not how you shut me up," says Zaki as he steps closer to her pressing back against her brick wall, and his lips on hers. Vio laces her fingers behind his neck, after all she can't  do much until the violinist takes a break from playing. Zaki had a way of making her let go, the nightmares of the past and worries of the future. There's just now, lost in his urgency, the urgency of this moment, a moment she prays will extend unto eternity. 

When strings cease to vibrate, she almost didn't notice. But Alan has helped her out many times, she needs to at least do this for him. She scans the streets, once again trying to gauge the rhythms of the day. There as a woman walking with a stroller; a puggy pink-faced sausage shop owner closing his shop for a nap. A man with a crew-cut sitting in the balcony of a tea parlour, with whom the violinist made eye-contract. The man wore a grey tank-top and long cargo pants, he tucked a few bills under the plate of the tea cup, and left the table.

"There!", she motions Zaki by tapping the back of her hand against his chest. "Let's follow him."



---

Unlike greater Ixan with had wide grid streets measured to precision by an obsessive compulsive civil engineer, the city's origins was a maze drawn by a toddler who tapped into his father's brandy cabin. Uneven cobblestone threaten to trip Vio, with every time the heal of boots lands. She begrudgingly accepted Zaki's arm as support, trying to not look like the one that is out of place as they followed the man from the tea parlour through these serpentine streets. 



The man walked through the service entrance of an opera house. Luckily the doors where wide open, with stage workers lugging carts of materials back and forth. They followed him up serval flights of stairs, and he walked through a set of velvet curtains into a brightly lit dressing room. Inside were two women, one was an unassuming blonde, who looked no longer than Vio by a few years. She was wearing a cream changing robe, and sitting in a chair. Behind her, combing the blonde's hair was the most regal looking woman Vio had ever set her eyes on. She was a thin middle age woman, with dark chestnut waves and silver roots all tied up in a neat bun. She had a sharp Cellian nose and deep set eyes and bold affirmative brows. She is wearing a deep violet dress, held firm by a silver corset. '*Didn't know people still wore corsets*' Vio says to herself silently.   '*She makes the extravagant ducci of Atonia to look like peasants.*' With her perfectly painted thin red lips, she motioned the blonde to leave. "Good luck tonight, Mitzi."

Mitzi, the blonde got up from the chair to turn to the older woman. "Thank you, Madame Juliette."   As she lifted the curtains to leave the dressing room, Zaki pulled Vio into a theater box to hide. Vio blushed in the dark embarrassed for having forgotten herself. "Juliette, Juliette," she whispered to herself, worried she will also forget a key piece of the information she was suppose to retrieve during this mission.

"So this new boyfriend of yours," Helga said between breathes, because she lifting front of a truck. Alan had called her, saying part of his car-jack broke and could use her superhuman strength. Somehow she got looped into spending her afternoon, a small garage the Harts had rented for their "projects". For Alan that was is weird hobby of modifying large vehiles. "you guys are really going to be an item. And it's not a fake out this time?" Neither of the Hart siblings had actually been in relationships. Whenever they got close to being with someone, then their potentail partner always ends up to either be with someone else, stay single, or move away. The abandonment always happened so suddenly, one moment they are happy and hopeful, the next they are crying in eachother's arms for weeks.

"I hope this one is going to be real. I'd beat Ada to be the first to get a boyfriend!" Alan says.

"You guys have a competition?" asks Helga.

"Well, Yi Han promised me that if I ever get a real boyfriend, he'll treat us to _." Alan says as he reachings for a wrench. "Bet he. Thinks I'll. Never. Get a boy. Friend." he states angrying as he tighten the knotch. He rolls out, wiping grease from his hands onto his forehead. "I'll show him."

"Why do you care so much what Yi Han thinks of you?" asks Helga.

"I feel like, sometimes he doesn't think I belong here." reflects Alan.

"In Galei? But you are both immigrants."

"By Ada's side. Maybe I am a bad brother. No matter how much I try to keep them away, I let them hurt Ada in the end. I can build big scary monster trucks, but I can't do anything if some jerk decides to run his wheels right on my sister's heart."

There was a long pause and silent sniffles, Helga could tell he is spending more time under the car to blink away his tears. "There is nothing you could have done, Ada will grow stronger from her pain." Helga tries reassure him.

"I'm worried, one day her heart will become so hard. She'll be able to get over anyone or anything. And nothing will ever matter anymore."

"You'll matter. No matter how many beaus and beaux catch her fancy, you'll always still be her number one human."

"I know," says Alan softly.

"Speaking of beaus, tell me about yours." Helga demands hoping to change to more cheerful topic. 



Helga shocked at Alan's ability to make a huger mess, in attempt to clean up, starts to loose her grip on the bumper. Just as when Alan completely rolls out from under the truck and announces "DONE!" Helga's arms give in and the whole front of the truck slides down, and front _.

"Dammit! I didn't unset the back-left jack yet."

> What is it that I want to est. with this scene? What is at the core of Helga & Alan's friendship other than they are both queer? How do they are both less scarred than many of the characters. Maybe it's their cheerful and optimistic outlook on life. What is their chat repoire? Alan - Ada is casually mocking, with touches of affection. Alan - Yi Han, Yi Han doubts Alan all the time, and Alan is constantly trying to prove his worth. When Yi Han starts flirting with Ada, they become awkwardly serious. Because Alan doesn't know how to feel about his long time friend getting with his sister. With Helga he is less guarded than he is with Yi Han, but definitely not as openly vulnerable as he is with Ada.

> So we can show him hold back a little when Helga probes too much.

> What exactly

>  They go back to Ace's apartment and is on the phone with Alan. Sicili over hears the name, and reveals that she knows her, because she used be invited to her house for dinners all the time with Lessa. She reveals that Juliette spends her Saturday nights at a gambling club.

>  Ace goes to the Harts to give them the information Sicili told them.



>  Ada gets sent to meet Juliette because she's a prodigy with cards.
