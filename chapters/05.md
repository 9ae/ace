The sun rose too early, every day for Alan, especially today. He did not want to leave the comfort of his bed and his company into the brisk Ixan autumn morning. Alan let his fingers slide through Adolf's blond tresses. When he leaned in to kiss him, Adolf's lashes fluttered ticking Alan's cheek. Adolf followed the tickles with a light peck, and slowly opened his eyes. They caught each other's lazy hazy eyes.

Adolf turned slightly away, and whispers "I have morning breathe".

"I don't care," declared Alan as he leaned in for a kiss. At that moment, all of Adolf's masks returned to their unstructured clay forms. For so long, he had not been intimate with someone, where he didn't have to play a role. Where he did not have to put on a form of perfect reflection of someone's desire. Alan had wanted him, morning breathe and all. He pressed himself into Alan fiercely, and Alan gripped Adolf back as if he was the edge of a tower. 



By the time they parted bodies, it was almost noon. "Fuck!" Adolf panics, "I'm suppose to meet my madame!"

"You have a pimp?" Alan raises an eyebrow.

"My madame looks after me," Adolf corrects. "She sends people to watch over me when I'm out on the streets."

"So she can count your patrons and knows how much of a cut she deserves." Alan theorizes.

Adolf ignores his comment, focused on getting dressed. Alan continues, "you know. I know string quartets. You can be playing the violin full-time?"

"I'm also content with playing the flute part time," Adolf winks. "Especially when I get to play with you." He kisses Alan and heads out Alan's room. Unfortunately, the kitchen was not empty.

A girl with red hair, and a boy with black hair and glasses were debating the proper ways to make tofu curry. The black haired boy looked at Adolf confused, but his companion smiled and introduced herself. "Hey I see you've kept my brother in late. Did you have fun?" She said with a rethorical wink.

Adolf blushed, well at least she wasn't his wife, as he initially suspected. He definitely had such awkward run ins, especially with the older wealthy men. He wondered which one was worst, finding out your husband has a mistress, or finding out he has a call boy.

"Would you like to stay for lunch?" She offered.

"We can't guarantee it will be good, as you see we are trying something experimental...." explains the boy with black hair.

"Thanks, but I gotta go." Adolf hurried out the door.

A few minutes after Adolf left, Alan went out into the kitchen. "What were you doing?!" he asked Ada, "I heard you back there."

"Afraid you sister is scared you new boyfriend away?" teased Yihan.

Alan sighed, "she always does."

"Only the best, are deserving of my genius brother." Ada confirms as she pinches Alan's cheek. "Curry?"

"like Nana used to make it?" Alan curiously peaked into the pot.

"Not exactly..." Yihan admitted.

"You want me to tail someone?" ask Vio. She and Zaki are in the Hart's dining room. After the failure of tofu curry, Ada and Yi Han went out to pick up pizza. 

 

"Well more like follow a people trail," explains Alan. "They may call be Galei's greatest hacker, but I know nil about field work. And there's not much I can gather with someone's who so... off-the-grid."



"Sure," says Zaki. "Who do you want us to stalk?"

"Alan said we should be looking for someone watching the violin boy." Zaki declares. Vio nods, scanning the low traffic commercial neighborhood. They were a few buildings away from where the street violinist had setup. Tucked in an alley, and her face tucked behind   the large collars of Zaki's trench coat.

She was had a knack for finding patterns. Everyone going about their day, had a rhythm within them. Those that didn't must be doing something out of the ordinary. But the enchanting draw of the violinist's strings had made it difficult for her to focus. 

"Do you think.." starts Zaki. Vio put her finger to his lips. "Oh you know that's how how you shut me up," says Zaki as he steps closer to her pressing back against her brick wall, and his lips on hers. Vio laces her fingers behind his neck, after all she can't  do much until the violinist takes a break from playing. Zaki had a way of making her let go, the nightmares of the past and worries of the future. There's just now, lost in his urgency, the urgency of this moment, a moment she prays will extend unto eternity. 

When strings cease to vibrate, she almost didn't notice.
