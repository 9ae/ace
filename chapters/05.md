The sun rose too early, every day for Alan, especially today. He did not want to leave the comfort of his bed and his company into the brisk autumn morning. Alan let his fingers slide through Adolf's blond tresses. When he leaned in to kiss him, Adolf's lashes fluttered ticking Alan's cheek. Adolf followed the tickles with a light peck, and slowly opened his eyes. They caught each other's lazy hazy eyes.

Adolf turned slightly away, and whispers "I have morning breathe".

"I don't care," declared Alan as he leaned in for a kiss. At that moment, all of Adolf's masks returned to their unstructured clay forms. For so long, he had not been intimate with someone, where he didn't have to play a role. Where he did not have to put on a form of perfect reflection of someone's desire. Alan had wanted him, morning breathe and all.

"I wish our times together weren't so time boxed and fleeting," muses Adolf.

"What about this weekend, we take the train to Ivonne? Instead of playing for others, we listen to others play for us. Maybe we can even get you a new violin, since the town is is known for the craftsmanship of string instruments." suggest Alan.

"I would love to, but I have to work this Saturday." says Adolf.

Alan looks disappointed, and a small part of him tingled in jealousy knowing that "work" meant that Adolf will be in the the arms of other men or women.

"Hey," says Adolf as he brushes Alans bangs away from his eyes. trying to cheer him up. "We have now," he pressed himself into Alan fiercely, and Alan gripped Adolf back as if he was the edge of a tower. 

By the time they parted bodies, it was almost noon. "Fuck!" Adolf panics, "I'm suppose to meet my madame!"

"You have a pimp?" Alan raises an eyebrow.

"My madame looks after me," Adolf corrects. "She sends people to watch over me when I'm out on the streets."

"So she can count your patrons and knows how much of a cut she deserves." Alan theorizes.

Adolf ignores his comment, focused on getting dressed. Alan continues, "you know. I know string quartets. You can be playing the violin full-time?"

"I'm also content with playing the flute part time," Adolf winks. "Especially when I get to play with you." He kisses Alan and heads out Alan's room. Unfortunately, the kitchen was not empty.

A girl with auburn hair, and a boy with black hair and glasses are debating the proper ways to make tofu curry. The black haired boy looks at Adolf confused, but his companion smiles and introduces herself. "Hey I see you've kept my brother in late. Did you have fun?" She says with a rethorical wink.

Adolf blushs, well at least she wasn't his wife, as he initially suspected. He definitely had such awkward run ins, especially with the older wealthy men. He wondered which one was worst, finding out your husband has a mistress, or finding out he has a call boy.

"Would you like to stay for lunch?" She offers.

"We can't guarantee it will be good, as you see we are trying something experimental...." explains the boy with black hair.

"Thanks, but I gotta go." Adolf hurries out the door.

A few minutes after Adolf left, Alan goes out into the kitchen. "What were you doing?!" he asks Ada, "I heard you back there."

"Afraid you sister is scared you new boyfriend away?" teases Yihan.

Alan sighed, "she always does."

"Only the best, are deserving of my genius brother." Ada confirms as she pinches Alan's cheek. "Curry?"

"like Nana used to make it?" Alan curiously peaks into the pot.

"Not exactly..." Ada admits.

When they were much younger, they lived with their grandmother in Wickshire while their parents, both diplomats, were away. She would make potato and chicken curry on the coldest of nights, and in the large northern plains there were may.

"Your sister thought it would be a genius idea combine her two favorite foods tofu and curry," Yihan explains.

"Turns out it was a mistake," says Ada. "Like that time when you took Philosophy of Science, when we were at uni."

"Yea, who knew the combination of my two favorite subjects would be so dry?!" says Alan.

"Just like this curry," says Ada. "What you think, should we add more coconut milk?"

"Umm, I'm allergic to coconut," says Yihan.

"Nonsense! Coconut milk always makes everything better!" says Alan.

"That's the truth," confirms his sister.

"Alright, I guess a little won't kill me," Yihan gives him. Ada generously pours coconut milk into the pot. Alan goes to shower while the curry cooks. Half a hour late, the Hart siblings and Yihan sit at the table tentatively stirring their late breakfast around. Yihan takes a small sip, *yup, this is definetly too much coconut milk!* But not wanting to be rude after all the hard work Ada has put into this, he tries to eat what he can before he inevitably will get nauseous.

"So," starts Ada, "the boy that just left. I swear I've seen him before."

"You probably have," says Yihan. "He's the street musician a flew blocks down. I pass by him all the time on my way here. He's pretty good."

"Yea, I know." says Alan. "Good enough to be in a concert hall, and I'm gonna try to get him into one. But I need your help."

"Who do you want me to talk up for you?" ask Ada.

"I need you two to tail him," he answers. "You see... Adolf... he also. On the side..." Alan pause, trying to find the words, and uncertain how to disclose this sensitive information about his lover.

"He's a prostitute," states Ada. He shouldn't be surprise, his sister always had a knack for being blunt and direct with him. She always told him the truth, even truths he didn't want to admit. "Com'on, a pretty boy twirling the fiddle in those shorts?!" she declares.

"Ada, you shouldn't make assumptions about people," says Yi Han.

"No, but she's right." says Alan softly. "And we are gonna get him out of it!"

"Because he no longer wants to that line of work? Or because you don't want him to be?" ask Ada.

"Why would *anyone* want to be in that line of work?" Yihan states rhetorically. "So what's the master plan?"

"It seems he works for a someone," says Alan.

"Like a pimp? Isn't that illegal?!" ask Ada.

"Yea, wasn't there a sex workers advocacy group a few yeas ago. They got the law passed that unless you are the one physically at work, profitting from sex work is illegal." recalls Yihan, whose near perfect memory continues to amaze them.

"So others won't take advantage of them," adds Ada.

"Exactly! So we need to find out who she is and proof that she has been profitting off other people's labor," says Alan enthusiastically.

"Great sounds like a plan!" says Yihan has he pushes his barely touched bowl of curry away and sprints towards the bathroom. 

"Guess, you should have listened when he said he was allergic," says Alan.

Ada fills a cup of water ready to hand over to Yihan and apologize for causing him to throw up.

"Alan said we should be looking for someone watching the violin boy." Yihan declares. Ada nods, scanning the low traffic commercial neighborhood. They were a few buildings away from where the street violinist had setup. Tucked in an alley, and her face tucked behind the large collars of Yihan's trench coat.

She was had a knack for finding patterns. Everyone going about their day, had a rhythm within them. Those that didn't must be doing something out of the ordinary. But the enchanting draw of the violinist's strings had made it difficult for her to focus. 

"Do you think.." starts Yihan. Ada put her finger to his lips. "Oh, you know that's not how you shut me up," says Yihan as he steps closer to her pressing back against her brick wall. Her fingers were still at his lips when he opens mouth, the tip of his tongue press into the pad of her index. She pushes her finger deeper into his open gasp, he nibbles on her middle finger as it joins the index in his mouth. Ada knows this was strange, not where she would have guessed their budding flirtation would be going. She's curious to know where this _ yet initimate moment would take them. After all she can't  do much until the violinist takes a break from playing. Yihan had a way of making her let go, the nightmares of the past and worries of the future. There's just now, lost in his mystery, the mystery of this moment, a moment she hope will somehow make sense. Maybe with a kiss?

When strings cease to vibrate, she almost didn't notice. But Yi Han pulls away and they were back their original stances, Ada wonders had she imagined the entire interaction. She scans the streets, once again trying to gauge the rhythms of the day. There as a woman walking with a stroller; a puggy pink-faced sausage shop owner closing his shop for a nap. A man with a crew-cut sitting in the balcony of a tea parlour, with whom the violinist made eye-contract. The man wore a grey tank-top and long cargo pants, he tucked a few bills under the plate of the tea cup, and left the table.

"There!", she motions Yihan by tapping the back of her hand against his chest. "Let's follow him."

---

Unlike greater Ixan with had wide grid streets measured to precision by an obsessive compulsive civil engineer, the city's origins was a maze drawn by a toddler who tapped into his father's brandy cabin. Uneven cobblestone threaten to trip Ada, with every time her boots' heel lands. She begrudgingly accepted Yihan's arm as support, trying to not look like the ones who are is out of place as they followed the man from the tea parlour through these serpentine streets. 

The man walked through the service entrance of an opera house. Luckily the doors where wide open, with stage workers lugging carts of materials back and forth. They followed him up serval flights of stairs, and he walked through a set of velvet curtains into a brightly lit dressing room. Inside were two women, one was an unassuming blonde, who looked no longer than Vio by a few years. She was wearing a cream changing robe, and sitting in a chair. Behind her, combing the blonde's hair was the most regal looking woman Yihan had ever set her eyes on. She was a thin middle age woman, with dark chestnut waves and silver roots all tied up in a neat bun. She had a sharp Cellian nose and deep set eyes and bold affirmative brows. She is wearing a deep violet dress, held firm by a silver corset. '*Didn't know people still wore corsets*' Ada says to herself silently.   '*She makes the extravagant ladies of the Great Empire to look like peasants.*' With her perfectly painted thin red lips, she motioned the blonde to leave. "Good luck tonight, Mitzi."

Mitzi, the blonde got up from the chair to turn to the older woman. "Thank you, Juliette."   As she lifted the curtains to leave the dressing room, Yihan pulled Ada into a theater box to hide. Ada blushed in the dark embarrassed for having forgotten herself. The main auditorium was empty, they are in a balcony next to the left mezzanine. She feels they are both exposed and private. From here they could still hear everything in the dressing room.

"Madame Rousseau," starts the man. "I checked with everyone, and they are all in for Saturday night at the Hotel Royale."

"Good, with our clients at the edge of their power, this may be the last card game for us," she replies. "In a month, will they even have money to lose? Or will they be scrambling to escape the country in secret. We don't know. But our trade will always be around in times of peace and in times of war. Here is the key to my office, will you get Mitzi's bond for me?"

"Yes, madame."

"Tonight is her last night, and she deserves to have it in her hands. Remember to mark your time in my account book, so I can pay you later."

"So this new boyfriend of yours," Helga said between breathes because she lifting front of a truck. Alan had called her, saying part of his car-jack broke and could use her superhuman strength. Somehow she got looped into spending her afternoon in a small garage the Harts had rented for their "projects". For Alan that was is weird hobby of modifying large vehiles. "you guys are really going to be an item. And it's not a fake out this time?" Neither of the Hart siblings had actually been in relationships. Whenever they got close to being with someone, then their potentail partner always ends up choosing either be with someone else, stay single, or move away. The abandonment always happened so suddenly, one moment they are happy and hopeful, the next one sibling is crying into the other's shoulders for weeks.

"I hope this one is going to be real. I'd beat Ada to be the first to get a boyfriend!" Alan says.

"You guys have a competition?" asks Helga.

"Well, Yi Han promised me that if I ever get a real boyfriend, he'll treat us to _." Alan says as he reachings for a wrench. "Bet he. Thinks I'll. Never. Get a boy. Friend." he states angrying as he tighten the knotch. He rolls out, wiping grease from his hands onto his forehead. "I'll show him."

"Why do you care so much what Yi Han thinks of you?" asks Helga.

"In boarding school we were always in the same classes. He was always a step ahead of me, in grades, sports, well not running I held the school record for that," explains Alan.

"See you beat him in some things," Helga reassures him.

Alan continues, "everyone loved him, did you know he got voted class president for three years in a row?! People tolerated me because I was just funny. Like I was the joke, and I acted like I didn't mind, so they kept me around."

"Did you mind?" ask Helga.

"Who wouldn't mind being laughed at all the time?!" says Alan. "But it was better than being all alone."

"You're not alone, you always had your older sister." says Helga.

"Ada then was too caught up in her notebook of calcuations and theorems to notice. And when she's not, she's too always heart broken over some idiot who took advantage of her firm belief that everyone has some good in them." Alan paused to caught his breath in the middle of his rant. When he started again, his paced his words slower, as if he is slowly thinking through.

"Maybe I am a bad brother. No matter how much I try to keep the assholes away, I let them hurt Ada in the end. I can build big scary monster trucks, but I can't do anything if some jerk decides to run his wheels right on my sister's heart."

There was a long pause and silent sniffles, Helga could tell he is spending more time under the car to blink away his tears. "There is nothing you could have done, Ada will grow stronger from her pain." Helga tries reassure him.

"I'm worried, one day she'll be able to get over anyone or anything. They are never fully gone. Each heartbreak is a brick laid upon the wall around our hearts. My sister, her's is becoming a tower. And nothing will ever matter to her anymore."

"You'll matter. No matter how many beaus and beaux catch her fancy, you'll always still be her number one human."

"I know," says Alan softly.

"Speaking of beaus, tell me about yours." Helga demands hoping to change to more cheerful topic. 

"Well, he plays the most beautiful songs. He's a violinist, who plays near my flat."

"I thought street performers were mostly an Atonia thing. The only Galeian street performers are..." Helga paused, uncertain of how to phrase it without suggesting that Alan's new boyfriend might be a...

"Street walkers," Alan finish her sentence with a sigh. "Yes, he is also that."

Helga didn't know how to respond to this awkward information. May girls like her are street walkers. Had she not been trained to be a field agent as Arend Rosenberg, she might have also found herself in the same profession.

"I'm trying to get him out of it though. I can get him a job with a real orchestra," says Alan.

"And that's something he wants?" ask Helga.

Alan shrugs, "Why would he not?!" 

Just then Ada walks into the garage carrying a large binder, and fanning herself with a few sheets of paper. "Geez, it reeks in here."

Alan rolls out from under the cart. "Halo sis!"

"Guess, what I've got?! Your boyfriend's bond papers! And his pimp's account book," Ada announces proudly. 

Alan looks at her a bit puzzled, not sure how these documents could get Adolf out of prostitution.

"Bond papers," Ada explains "are how pimps get their workers to stick with them. They lend them a large sum of money when in need, and then make them work it off their debt."

"How much was his bond?" ask Helga.

"Let's see a few years ago, she lent him 40,000. Every month she takes 10% off his earnings, plus 7% protection services," reads Ada. She opens the account book, flipping through the pages performing record breaking speed arithmetic. "Wow, now he only owes her 2,300." 

"What?! That's not much." says Alan.

"In fact, we can win Adolf's freedom in one night!" delclares Ada.

"How?" ask Alan. "It's a small sum, but way more than what we have in our savings."

"It seems every month there's a spike in earnings on the third Saturday." say Ada as she flips through the account books. I believe she goes to a secret card games club held at Hotel Royale. One likely frequented by Galei's politicians and celebrities to gain clientele."

"Ah, that's where Adolf is this Saturday." reflects Alan.

"Probably. But did you hear? It's a card game! That's how we won our passage away from the riots and safely into Ixan." says Ada excitedly.

"Well, I suppose we can put your gambling habit to good use," agrees Alan.

"What will you do without me?" says Ada messing up his hair with her hands. Unfortunately her palms ends up drawing a smear of black grease. "Ew."

"If you're are going in making demands with a well connected madame, we'll need some guns." says Helga pulling out her phone. "Unfortunately, I'm have to seen my grandma this Saturday, but I'll get you some knife power."

Times when both Alighieri sisters were home, where one wasn't on the way out as the other returns is rare. Normally it worked out alright, because it was not as if they had spent very much quality time together as children. Sicili had her group of friends, and Vio mostly kept to herself. Sicili had been trying to call the building superintendent to fix their stove vent. He told her he'll get someone to look into it, but that was a month and 6 phone calls ago. As they were undocumented residents, there was much leverage nor legal action they could have taken. So she was grateful that her sister finally had some time to look at the ancient machine.

"Will you hand me the screw driver?" ask Vio as she examined under the hood. 

"Philips or flat?" Sicili asked digging through the toolbox.

"Philips please!" 

Vio's phone rang. Sicili went over to hand her sister both her screwdriver and her phone. "It's Helga."

Vio puts the hood down and answers her phone. "Hey. This Saturday, yea I'm off." This Saturday Zaki was going to take the sisters to the butterfly exhibit at The Conservatory. "Alan wants my help with someone named Juliette Rousseau? Who is she?"

Helga briefs her colleague on the whole plan as Vio listens and jots down notes on a cloth napkin. "Well, I guess. Ok, I'll meet them at their flat at 7. No problem, after all the Harts have done so much for us." When then hang up, she turns to her Sicili. "Something at work came up. You guys will have to go without me." Even though this technically wasn't work related, it was probably more work to explain the favors their teammates and these government intelligence officers did for each other. 

"Uh ok. By the way did you mention Juliette Rousseau?" asks Sicili.

Vio raises her eyebrow suspiciously. "How do *you* know her?!"

"Lessa worked for her." Sicili answers casually. "We used to go over to her house during the holidays. Since we had no other family, she treated us like her family. In some ways, she was more of a mother to us than our mother had been."

"Oh," she turns her attention back to the broken vent. Unable to shake off the tight feeling in her stomach. She was going to help blackmail a pimp who was been there for her family when she couldn't be. Would she had said no to helping if she had known? She can't wait to meet the lady who temporary held her place, while she struggled through the desserts and mountains to reunite with her sister and cousin. It wasn't hard for any woman to be a better mother than theirs. She was too busy running the family business to get to know her own daughters. One year when Vio won first place in the regional co-ed martial arts championship, her mother ordered a cake that read "Congratulations Sicili!" Is she about to take down the only woman who was kind to the Alighieri girls?

---

When Vio walked in the Hart's place, it looked like a tornado sweep from their closets to the living room. Shirts, hair accessories, neck ties, shoes were scattered everywhere. The siblings were no where in sight, Yi Han viciously typing away at his laptop."Sorry, I just need to finish setting this one thing in motion," he apologize.

"No need to apologize, you don't even live here" says Vio.

"Argh! Alan did you borrow my countouring kit again?!" yells Ada from one of their bedrooms.

"Ooops yea," Alan rushes out in a pale lavender dress shirt and pinstripe black slacks carrying a box of make-up. 

"You'd think they are just like you," starts Yihan. "But don't forget, they are just spoiled rich kids."

"I never forget," says Vio.

"Me too," Yihan smile, and continues to hold eye contact for well over 10 seconds.

Vio felt so awkward that she turned away and said facing the toaster, "So, what's the plan for tonight?"

"Alan and Ada are going to Hotel Royale's upper conference rooms, where a private high rolling game room is in place. You and I sneak in as service staff, he points to a set of uniforms hanging on the coat rack."

Vio makes a cringe at the forrest green and periwinkle uniforms. 

"Yea, I know. Maybe they make their staff look bad, so they can perpetually be humble. Alan will be keeping tabs on Juliette Rousseau." He pushed a photo of a regal looking woman. She had not expect the woman Sicili talked about to look so stern. In some way, Juliette exerted a similar aurora as her mother. Both woman had a sense of holding authority with the way their eyebrows set; when you walked into a room, there was no mistake who was in charge.

"And what will we be doing?" asks Vio.

"We will be keeping an eye on Alan, since he's likely to let his mind wander and forget his task."

"Hey! I've heard that," yells Alan from Ada's room.

"Well for the most part, keeping track of the brats. Making sure they don't get into any fights, drink too much. And Ada..."

"will be making 30 grand tonight!" Ada walks into the room wearing a long emerald gown. Her auburn hair rolled into curls that framed her cheeks. Yihan looked at her for a long moment. She twitched a crimson and silver fan around her hands nervously.
