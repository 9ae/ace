The sun rose too early, every day for Alan, especially today. He did not want to leave the comfort of his bed and his company into the brisk autumn morning. Alan let his fingers slide through Adolf's blond tresses. When he leaned in to kiss him, Adolf's lashes fluttered ticking Alan's cheek. Adolf followed the tickles with a light peck, and slowly opened his eyes. They caught each other's lazy hazy eyes.

Adolf turned slightly away, and whispers "I have morning breathe".

"I don't care," declared Alan as he leaned in for a kiss. At that moment, all of Adolf's masks returned to their unstructured clay forms. For so long, he had not been intimate with someone, where he didn't have to play a role. Where he did not have to put on a form of perfect reflection of someone's desire. Alan had wanted him, morning breathe and all. He pressed himself into Alan fiercely, and Alan gripped Adolf back as if he was the edge of a tower. 



By the time they parted bodies, it was almost noon. "Fuck!" Adolf panics, "I'm suppose to meet my madame!"

"You have a pimp?" Alan raises an eyebrow.

"My madame looks after me," Adolf corrects. "She sends people to watch over me when I'm out on the streets."

"So she can count your patrons and knows how much of a cut she deserves." Alan theorizes.

Adolf ignores his comment, focused on getting dressed. Alan continues, "you know. I know string quartets. You can be playing the violin full-time?"

"I'm also content with playing the flute part time," Adolf winks. "Especially when I get to play with you." He kisses Alan and heads out Alan's room. Unfortunately, the kitchen was not empty.

A girl with auburn hair, and a boy with black hair and glasses are debating the proper ways to make tofu curry. The black haired boy looks at Adolf confused, but his companion smiles and introduces herself. "Hey I see you've kept my brother in late. Did you have fun?" She says with a rethorical wink.

Adolf blushs, well at least she wasn't his wife, as he initially suspected. He definitely had such awkward run ins, especially with the older wealthy men. He wondered which one was worst, finding out your husband has a mistress, or finding out he has a call boy.

"Would you like to stay for lunch?" She offers.

"We can't guarantee it will be good, as you see we are trying something experimental...." explains the boy with black hair.

"Thanks, but I gotta go." Adolf hurries out the door.

A few minutes after Adolf left, Alan goes out into the kitchen. "What were you doing?!" he asks Ada, "I heard you back there."

"Afraid you sister is scared you new boyfriend away?" teases Yihan.

Alan sighed, "she always does."

"Only the best, are deserving of my genius brother." Ada confirms as she pinches Alan's cheek. "Curry?"

"like Nana used to make it?" Alan curiously peaks into the pot.

"Not exactly..." Ada admits.

When they were much younger, they lived with their grandmother in Wickshire while their parents, both diplomats, were away. She would make potato and chicken curry on the coldest of nights, and in the large northern plains there were may.

"Your sister thought it would be a genius idea combine her two favorite foods tofu and curry," Yihan explains.

"Turns out it was a mistake," says Ada. "Like that time when you took Philosophy of Science, when we were at uni."

"Yea, who knew the combination of my two favorite subjects would be so dry?!" says Alan.

"Just like this curry," says Ada. "What you think, should we add more coconut milk?"

"Umm, I'm allergic to coconut," says Yihan.

"Nonsense! Coconut milk always makes everything better!" says Alan.

"That's the truth," confirms his sister.

"Alright, I guess a little won't kill me," Yihan gives him. Ada generously pours coconut milk into the pot. Alan goes to shower while the curry cooks. Half a hour late, the Hart siblings and Yihan sit at the table tentatively stirring their late breakfast around. Yihan takes a small sip, *yup, this is definetly too much coconut milk!* But not wanting to be rude after all the hard work Ada has put into this, he tries to eat what he can before he inevitably will get nauseous.

"So," starts Ada, "the boy that just left. I swear I've seen him before."

"You probably have," says Yihan. "He's the street musician a flew blocks down. I pass by him all the time on my way here. He's pretty good."

"Yea, I know." says Alan. "Good enough to be in a concert hall, and I'm gonna try to get him into one. But I need your help."

"Who do you want me to talk up for you?" ask Ada.

"I need you two to tail him," he answers. "You see... Adolf... he also. On the side..." Alan pause, trying to find the words, and uncertain how to disclose this sensitive information about his lover.

"He's a prostitute," states Ada. He shouldn't be surprise, his sister always had a knack for being blunt and direct with him. She always told him the truth, even truths he didn't want to admit. "Com'on, a pretty boy twirling the fiddle in those shorts?!" she declares.

"Ada, you shouldn't make assumptions about people," says Yi Han.

"No, but she's right." says Alan softly. "And we are gonna get him out of it!"

"Because he no longer wants to that line of work? Or because you don't want him to be?" ask Ada.

"Why would *anyone* want to be in that line of work?" Yihan states rhetorically. "So what's the master plan?"

"It seems he works for a someone," says Alan.

"Like a pimp? Isn't that illegal?!" ask Ada.

"Yea, wasn't there a sex workers advocacy group a few yeas ago. They got the law passed that unless you are the one physically at work, profitting from sex work is illegal." recalls Yihan, whose near perfect memory continues to amaze them.

"So others won't take advantage of them," adds Ada.

"Exactly! So we need to find out who she is and proof that she has been profitting off other people's labor," says Alan enthusiastically.

"Great sounds like a plan!" says Yihan has he pushes his barely touched bowl of curry away and sprints towards the bathroom. 

"Guess, you should have listened when he said he was allergic," says Alan.

Ada fills a cup of water ready to hand over to Yihan and apologize for causing him to throw up.

"Alan said we should be looking for someone watching the violin boy." Yihan declares. Ada nods, scanning the low traffic commercial neighborhood. They were a few buildings away from where the street violinist had setup. Tucked in an alley, and her face tucked behind the large collars of Yihan's trench coat.

She was had a knack for finding patterns. Everyone going about their day, had a rhythm within them. Those that didn't must be doing something out of the ordinary. But the enchanting draw of the violinist's strings had made it difficult for her to focus. 

"Do you think.." starts Yihan. Ada put her finger to his lips. "Oh, you know that's not how you shut me up," says Yihan as he steps closer to her pressing back against her brick wall. Her fingers were still at his lips when he opens mouth, the tip of his tongue press into the pad of her index. She pushes her finger deeper into his open gasp, he nibbles on her middle finger as it joins the index in his mouth. Ada knows this was strange, not where she would have guessed their budding flirtation would be going. She's curious to know where this _ yet initimate moment would take them. After all she can't  do much until the violinist takes a break from playing. Yihan had a way of making her let go, the nightmares of the past and worries of the future. There's just now, lost in his mystery, the mystery of this moment, a moment she hope will somehow make sense. Maybe with a kiss?

When strings cease to vibrate, she almost didn't notice. But Yi Han pulls away and they were back their original stances, Ada wonders had she imagined the entire interaction. She scans the streets, once again trying to gauge the rhythms of the day. There as a woman walking with a stroller; a puggy pink-faced sausage shop owner closing his shop for a nap. A man with a crew-cut sitting in the balcony of a tea parlour, with whom the violinist made eye-contract. The man wore a grey tank-top and long cargo pants, he tucked a few bills under the plate of the tea cup, and left the table.

"There!", she motions Yihan by tapping the back of her hand against his chest. "Let's follow him."

---

Unlike greater Ixan with had wide grid streets measured to precision by an obsessive compulsive civil engineer, the city's origins was a maze drawn by a toddler who tapped into his father's brandy cabin. Uneven cobblestone threaten to trip Ada, with every time her boots' heel lands. She begrudgingly accepted Yihan's arm as support, trying to not look like the ones who are is out of place as they followed the man from the tea parlour through these serpentine streets. 

The man walked through the service entrance of an opera house. Luckily the doors where wide open, with stage workers lugging carts of materials back and forth. They followed him up serval flights of stairs, and he walked through a set of velvet curtains into a brightly lit dressing room. Inside were two women, one was an unassuming blonde, who looked no longer than Vio by a few years. She was wearing a cream changing robe, and sitting in a chair. Behind her, combing the blonde's hair was the most regal looking woman Yihan had ever set her eyes on. She was a thin middle age woman, with dark chestnut waves and silver roots all tied up in a neat bun. She had a sharp Cellian nose and deep set eyes and bold affirmative brows. She is wearing a deep violet dress, held firm by a silver corset. '*Didn't know people still wore corsets*' Ada says to herself silently.   '*She makes the extravagant ladies of the Great Empire to look like peasants.*' With her perfectly painted thin red lips, she motioned the blonde to leave. "Good luck tonight, Mitzi."

Mitzi, the blonde got up from the chair to turn to the older woman. "Thank you, Madame Juliette."   As she lifted the curtains to leave the dressing room, Yihan pulled Ada into a theater box to hide. Ada blushed in the dark embarrassed for having forgotten herself. "Juliette, Juliette," she whispered to herself, worried she will also forget a key piece of the information she was suppose to retrieve during this mission. The main auditorium was empty, they are in a balcony next to the left mezzanine. She feels they are both exposed and private. She's runs through the next moment in her mind several times before committing it.

> Ada summons Vio and Zaki to break into their office

"So this new boyfriend of yours," Helga said between breathes because she lifting front of a truck. Alan had called her, saying part of his car-jack broke and could use her superhuman strength. Somehow she got looped into spending her afternoon in a small garage the Harts had rented for their "projects". For Alan that was is weird hobby of modifying large vehiles. "you guys are really going to be an item. And it's not a fake out this time?" Neither of the Hart siblings had actually been in relationships. Whenever they got close to being with someone, then their potentail partner always ends up choosing either be with someone else, stay single, or move away. The abandonment always happened so suddenly, one moment they are happy and hopeful, the next one sibling is crying into the other's shoulders for weeks.

"I hope this one is going to be real. I'd beat Ada to be the first to get a boyfriend!" Alan says.

"You guys have a competition?" asks Helga.

"Well, Yi Han promised me that if I ever get a real boyfriend, he'll treat us to _." Alan says as he reachings for a wrench. "Bet he. Thinks I'll. Never. Get a boy. Friend." he states angrying as he tighten the knotch. He rolls out, wiping grease from his hands onto his forehead. "I'll show him."

"Why do you care so much what Yi Han thinks of you?" asks Helga.

"In boarding school we were always in the same classes. He was always a step ahead of me, in grades, sports, well not running I held the school record for that," explains Alan.

"See you beat him in some things," Helga reassures him.

Alan continues, "everyone loved him, did you know he got voted class president for three years in a row?! People tolerated me because I was just funny. Like I was the joke, and I acted like I didn't mind, so they kept me around."

"Did you mind?" ask Helga.

"Who wouldn't mind being laughed at all the time?!" says Alan. "But it was better than being all alone."

"You're not alone, you always had your older sister." says Helga.

"Ada then was too caught up in her notebook of calcuations and theorems to notice. And when she's not, she's too always heart broken over some idiot who took advantage of her firm belief that everyone has some good in them." Alan paused to caught his breath in the middle of his rant. When he started again, his paced his words slower, as if he is slowly thinking through.

"Maybe I am a bad brother. No matter how much I try to keep the assholes away, I let them hurt Ada in the end. I can build big scary monster trucks, but I can't do anything if some jerk decides to run his wheels right on my sister's heart."

There was a long pause and silent sniffles, Helga could tell he is spending more time under the car to blink away his tears. "There is nothing you could have done, Ada will grow stronger from her pain." Helga tries reassure him.

"I'm worried, one day her heart will become so hard. She'll be able to get over anyone or anything. And nothing will ever matter to her anymore."

"You'll matter. No matter how many beaus and beaux catch her fancy, you'll always still be her number one human."

"I know," says Alan softly.

"Speaking of beaus, tell me about yours." Helga demands hoping to change to more cheerful topic. 

"Well, he plays the most beautiful songs. He's a violinist, who plays near my flat."

"I thought street performers were mostly an Atonia thing. The only Galeian street performers are..." Helga paused, uncertain of how to phrase it without suggesting that Alan's new boyfriend might be a...

"Street walkers," Alan finish her sentence with a sigh. "Yes, he is also that."

Helga didn't know how to respond to this awkward information. May girls like her are street walkers. Had she not been trained to be a field agent as Arend Rosenberg, she might have also found herself in the same profession.

"I'm trying to get him out of it though. I can get him a job with a real orchestra," says Alan.

"And that's something he wants?"

"Why would he not?!" Just then Alan's phone rings. He rolls out from under the cart.

"Halo!" answers Alan cheerfully. "Hey Ace!"

"Wait, you also got Adolf's bond papers?!" he asked in surprise. "How much was his bond to Juliette?"

Vio muttered something about the bond, which was a paper most prostitues sign with their pimp. Often they end up working for their pimp because they were lent a large sum of money, in which they are obligated to work off to repay.

"What?! Only four thousand is left?! That's not much." says Alan.

A voice from the background of Vio's line mutter something. "Wait, Sicili saids she... she knows her? Hold on," she puts her sister of speaker phone.

"Hello?" says an airy voice. 

"Hi there," Alan answers. "You know the woman your sister is referring to?"

"Yes, Mrs. Juliette Rousseau. My late cousin worked with her. We used to go over to her house during the holidays. Vio wasn't here yet, and we had no other family. So she treated us like her family." says Sicili.

"When you mean, worked with her?" says Alan.

"Well Juliette ran a brothel at that time, but after Lessa's death it got shut down."

"So now, how does she gather clientele?"

"I think she still makes her rounds at the Royale. In the executive meeting rooms on Saturday nights, is a secret card games club. It's frequented by Galei's politicians and celebrities."

"Perfect!" Alan says with sly smile. "And I've got just the right card up my sleeve. Thank you, Sicili. Hopefully your sister will bring you over for tea sometime." says Alan as they switch back to Vio on the phone. 

"Ada and I have got the rest. Ciao, mio caro!" says Alan cheerfully. Vio muttered something angrily about cultural appropriation.

> How that we have her name what happens? How do they get blackmail on her? That even though sex work is legal in Galei. It's illegal for someone to take a paycut from it. This law was made to protect sex workers from pimps. Juliette is more of a union leader, but there's no precedence for united sex worker's union, so by the law she is considered a pimp. And they need to unionize because even though sex workers are guaranteed the same protection as everyone else, they are rarely taken seriously by the law.
