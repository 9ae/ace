# The undertow creeps in slow

Ace is washing the blood clean in the shower. Flashes back to Ace killing at the Varin church, flashes of a bunch of other times she's fugued.

- During the mountain raid
- several times when she was fighting with the mountain tribes
- on the road to Ixan
- several times on the job

Meanwhile Zaki is outside feeling guilty that he had double crossed them. What for does his guilt come in, he's furiously pacing and talking to himself, trying to convince that he had to take the job. The agents wants not going to let him alive had they told him about it, and he didn't accept.

He goes to find Ace hunched over in the shower shivering. After he brings her out and dresses in a robe, they talk.

Since most of the action in this chapter is in the flashbacks, what flashbacks to we want to show?

Z suggest if she just embraces her killer instinct and be in the moment she can take control over it instead of it controlling her.

He calls it her natural talent, but to harness it she must take ownership of it. He compares it ti painting...

 V says she doesn't want to have these abilities and worries that she may hurt someone she loves one day.

She asks him why if he could make a good living painting replicas does he also take on other side gigs. He talks about constantly feeling insecure in Galei. Like a permament guess who may be asked to leave at any time.

Z: You think it gets easier, but it never does... (the killing).

`Zaki tells the story of how his parents got killed. and years after finding one of the people who went to their house that night and taking vengence`

Here we look at how Zaki feels about his relationship with Galei gov, that he is always a guest in this country that he is born in.

V disagrees about revenge. She knows it will only breed more hatred, the family who attacked hers had a grudge when they killed their grandfather. The Antonia local wars and the mountain tribe fights was all about their vengence chain.

Z tells her she is in the wrong job, if she doesn't want to kill. V said she was born to kill, we actually get a confirmed explanation of what her family does, and how she was born into her family to one day take over. But he doesn't have to, he's such a talented painter, he can make a perfect living just forging paintings or even paint some of his own stuff. If he can just let this go, forget the hunt.

In the spur of the moment she proposes they run away together (with Sicili), and he can forget all this.

She let's it cloak her body. The warm water _ it's tendrils through her hair, arms, and waist. Vivara Aligheiri stands in the steaming showers of the only in in town, eager to expel the blood of both hers and not from her skin. Given the nature of her work, washing blood from her body is not new. But normally she can account for every stain. They called her Ace because her aims were percise. Not a wasted swipe was made with her knives. There were times she's missed, faltered, and lost control... there were times when she lost herself.

The first time it happened was the night of her first kill. She remembers needing to protect Sicili from the prying hands of a mountain bandit. Next thing she knew he was screaming, holding on to the emptiness that once holstered his privattes, crying his last cries. Blood covered him, it was on the horses, on the fellow bandits, blood on her own hands. She was barely able to process what had happened, when one of their horses frightend by the chaos knocked her over down the ravine.

During the years she's lived alone in the mountains, she tried to understand the powers she had harness that night. But no matter what danger she was in, she was not able to tap into whatever spell that overtook her. Not the night she was hunted by a pack of wolves, nor when _. There were times she she tried to trigger it by putting hersel in dangerous situations. Jumping to attack a caravan of mountain tribe warriors was one them. As a young girl, her nanny told her stories of the fierece mountain people, who lived to defend their small patches of land. Unlike the Atonians who schemed and backstabbed eachother, the mountain dwellers battled with honor. A surrender was always honest, a truce or alliance was never violated. After her mother found out that the nanny had been telling her these bedtime stories, she never saw her caretaker again. They were dangerous fairytales to tell a hieress to one day become an Atonian warlord. Any leader foolish enough to practice honor will be crushed, by neighboring lords. She had long dreamed about being a mountain warrior instead of Renova's leader. She dreamed of being free from the mind games the Atonian nobility play with eachother. She had no tack nor knack for schemes and intrigue. Not when she could barely read the facial expressions of her own family. The Falcon Tribe was the first time she actually saw the legendary mountain warriors in person.

Vio turns of the water in the shower sprout. But she doesn't leave the bathing area. Instead she lets a spider she found climbing up the water sprout, climb onto her fingers. Opening the small window in the shower stall, she let's the spider go back outside. The second time her fighting overtook her was a day just like this one, by then she had become part of the Falcon tribe, a mountain warrior fighting with them.

> The second time it manifest was during a battle with her tribe, and she was trying to protect her adoptive mother. Erik ends up getting seriously hurt when she was in a trance. She now realizes that this mysterious power is too unpredictable to possess, and now hates it.
