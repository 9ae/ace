# The undertow creeps in slow

Ace is washing the blood clean in the shower. Flashes back to Ace killing at the Varin church, flashes of a bunch of other times she's fugued.

- During the mountain raid
- several times when she was fighting with the mountain tribes
- on the road to Ixan
- several times on the job

Meanwhile Zaki is outside feeling guilty that he had double crossed them. What for does his guilt come in, he's furiously pacing and talking to himself, trying to convince that he had to take the job. The agents wants not going to let him alive had they told him about it, and he didn't accept.

He goes to find Ace hunched over in the shower shivering. After he brings her out and dresses in a robe, they talk.

Since most of the action in this chapter is in the flashbacks, what flashbacks to we want to show?

Z suggest if she just embraces her killer instinct and be in the moment she can take control over it instead of it controlling her.

He calls it her natural talent, but to harness it she must take ownership of it. He compares it ti painting...

 V says she doesn't want to have these abilities and worries that she may hurt someone she loves one day.

She asks him why if he could make a good living painting replicas does he also take on other side gigs. He talks about constantly feeling insecure in Galei. Like a permament guess who may be asked to leave at any time.

Z: You think it gets easier, but it never does... (the killing).

`Zaki tells the story of how his parents got killed. and years after finding one of the people who went to their house that night and taking vengence`

Here we look at how Zaki feels about his relationship with Galei gov, that he is always a guest in this country that he is born in.

V disagrees about revenge. She knows it will only breed more hatred, the family who attacked hers had a grudge when they killed their grandfather. The Antonia local wars and the mountain tribe fights was all about their vengence chain.

Z tells her she is in the wrong job, if she doesn't want to kill. V said she was born to kill, we actually get a confirmed explanation of what her family does, and how she was born into her family to one day take over. But he doesn't have to, he's such a talented painter, he can make a perfect living just forging paintings or even paint some of his own stuff. If he can just let this go, forget the hunt.

In the spur of the moment she proposes they run away together (with Sicili), and he can forget all this.

She let's it cloak her body. The warm water_ it's tendrils through her hair, arms, and waist. Vivara Aligheiri stands in the steaming showers of the only in in town, eager to expel the blood of both hers and not from her skin.
