# The undertow creeps in slow

Ace is washing the blood clean in the shower. Flashes back to Ace killing at the Varin church, flashes of a bunch of other times she's fugued.

- During the mountain raid
- several times when she was fighting with the mountain tribes
- on the road to Ixan
- several times on the job

Meanwhile Zaki is outside feeling guilty that he had double crossed them. What for does his guilt come in, he's furiously pacing and talking to himself, trying to convince that he had to take the job. The agents wants not going to let him alive had they told him about it, and he didn't accept.

He goes to find Ace hunched over in the shower shivering. After he brings her out and dresses in a robe, they talk.

Since most of the action in this chapter is in the flashbacks, what flashbacks to we want to show?

Z suggest if she just embraces her killer instinct and be in the moment she can take control over it instead of it controlling her.

He calls it her natural talent, but to harness it she must take ownership of it. He compares it ti painting...

 V says she doesn't want to have these abilities and worries that she may hurt someone she loves one day.

She asks him why if he could make a good living painting replicas does he also take on other side gigs. He talks about constantly feeling insecure in Galei. Like a permament guess who may be asked to leave at any time.

Z: You think it gets easier, but it never does... (the killing).

`Zaki tells the story of how his parents got killed. and years after finding one of the people who went to their house that night and taking vengence`

Here we look at how Zaki feels about his relationship with Galei gov, that he is always a guest in this country that he is born in.

V disagrees about revenge. She knows it will only breed more hatred, the family who attacked hers had a grudge when they killed their grandfather. The Antonia local wars and the mountain tribe fights was all about their vengence chain.

Z tells her she is in the wrong job, if she doesn't want to kill. V said she was born to kill, we actually get a confirmed explanation of what her family does, and how she was born into her family to one day take over. But he doesn't have to, he's such a talented painter, he can make a perfect living just forging paintings or even paint some of his own stuff. If he can just let this go, forget the hunt.

In the spur of the moment she proposes they run away together (with Sicili), and he can forget all this.

She let's it cloak her body. The warm water _ it's tendrils through her hair, arms, and waist. Vivara Aligheiri stands in the steaming showers of the only in in town, eager to expel the blood of both hers and not from her skin. Given the nature of her work, washing blood from her body is not new. But normally she can account for every stain. They called her Ace because her aims were percise. Not a wasted swipe was made with her knives. There were times she's missed, faltered, and lost control... there were times when she lost herself.

The first time it happened was the night of her first kill. She remembers needing to protect Sicili from the prying hands of a mountain bandit. Next thing she knew he was screaming, holding on to the emptiness that once holstered his privattes, crying his last cries. Blood covered him, it was on the horses, on the fellow bandits, blood on her own hands. She was barely able to process what had happened, when one of their horses frightend by the chaos knocked her over down the ravine.

During the years she's lived alone in the mountains, she tried to understand the powers she had harness that night. But no matter what danger she was in, she was not able to tap into whatever spell that overtook her. Not the night she was hunted by a pack of wolves, nor when _. There were times she she tried to trigger it by putting hersel in dangerous situations. Jumping to attack a caravan of mountain tribe warriors was one them. As a young girl, her nanny told her stories of the fierece mountain people, who lived to defend their small patches of land. Unlike the Atonians who schemed and backstabbed eachother, the mountain dwellers battled with honor. A surrender was always honest, a truce or alliance was never violated. After her mother found out that the nanny had been telling her these bedtime stories, she never saw her caretaker again. They were dangerous fairytales to tell a hieress to one day become an Atonian warlord. Any leader foolish enough to practice honor will be crushed, by neighboring lords. She had long dreamed about being a mountain warrior instead of Renova's leader. She dreamed of being free from the mind games the Atonian nobility play with eachother. She had no tack nor knack for schemes and intrigue. Not when she could barely read the facial expressions of her own family. The Falcon Tribe was the first time she actually saw the legendary mountain warriors in person.

Vio turns of the water in the shower sprout. But she doesn't leave the bathing area. Instead she lets a spider she found climbing up the water sprout, climb onto her fingers. Opening the small window in the shower stall, she let's the spider go back outside. The second time her fighting overtook her was a day just like this one, by then she had become part of the Falcon tribe, a mountain warrior fighting with them.

The snow on the plataue had only started to melt late into the 3rd month of the year. The sun helped it a little further along today. There was nowhere to hide in this battle fought on a late morning with the encroaching Tiger tribe. Spring was a time for the mountain tribes to exchange hands and lands. It's been a year since the Falcon tribe adopted her into their family. Yule, or only known Jyri back then, retrained her killer instinct to fight people instead of hunting prey.

Now she fights along their side, a crescent dagger in each hand. Standing back to back with Erik, they parried with the three men surrounding them. Just as they are about to take the last man down, Erik yells "mum!". They adoptive mother was knocked off her horse as her attacked speared the neck of the steed. Vio felt her arms move on their own as her left arm swung hard and fast through the neck of their last opponent standing. By the time she regained awareness the battle had ended. Even though their tribe had successfully defend their land, there were significant casualities. Their adoptive mother hand her arm in a sling, having broken it by the fall. More so, she refused to look at Vio in the eye. Because she saw the girl, plung a blade into her younger son's torso. A few inches left, it would have struck his heart. Erik, said he was fine and no bones in his rib cage was broken as the healers closed up up the wound. He even made a joke about how he'll always have the mark she left close to his heart. No one laughed.

That night, she couldn't sleep with the family in their tent. She stepped outside, all the snow of the clearing they had spent the winter in had melted from the friction of battle. But it was still cold, with the sun long set. Jyri was keeping watch by a fire pit; timidly she went up sit there in the warmer area. He noticed her, but like the rest of the family today didn't look or greet her. They watched the flames flicker in silence for a long time.

Jyri finally spoke, "Erik said you were fighting blindly, stupidly." Vio only nodded. Jyri continued, "he was worried you might hurt yourself, before rushed into their barrier. He tried to hold you back. Then you turned around and stabbed him."

"I didn't realize, it was him," she said softly. In some ways she really had been blind, but she didn't know how to explain it to Jyri. She didn't know how to explain to the person who took her into his family, how she had stabbed his little brother. She didn't know the words to describe what had been happening to her. Even if she did, she didn't think he would believe her. Anything she say would just sound like an excuse, so she said nothing. And again they returned to their silence.

When Jyri's shift is about to end, he stood up to find the next tribeman on rotation. "I don't think you should fight anymore."

"What?!" Vio looked up at him.

"You are one of our most talented fighters. You bring a style that no one has seen, and it gives our tribe a competetive advantage."

Vio blushes, when he compliments her.

"But, until you can control yourself in battle you are a risk we cannot deploy."

"Then what do I..." Vio started to ask.

"You seem really good with animals. Why don't you lead our hunting dogs for a while." Jyri said tersely as he leaves. "Good night, Ace."

Not wanting to deal with whoever was next on watch, who will probably look at her begrudgingly, she went to spend the rest of her night behind a tree, with her head buried in her knees.

And in the bathing stall of a guest room in Varin, Vio remains on the cold wet tile floor. Her head burying into her knees.

Zaki paces around the dark room. It had only two dim floor lamps. There was a wide window, that lead out to a balcony but tonight was a new moon. Varin was a town too polluted to see many stars. It looked like no one had occupied it for a long time, a thin layer of dusk coated the walnut wood furniture. Two twin beds placed perpendicular to eachother, a writing table stationed near one of the beds. On it laid three holy scriptures. The Lygeian bible, the _ (holy text of the Hastuit), and the _ (an eastern religious scripture). Above the desk in a fairly comtemporary painting of large lips pucked up and a painted pointer finger held up to them. It looked out of place next to the furniture near a century old.

After the they fought off Edgar's special forces, Yule insisted that Vio will need some tiem to recover. He took the painting they came to town to find and the evening train back to the city. The people at the church guided them to the only inn still in business in the quiet town. Vio has not said a word during their walk here. She simply nods or shakes her head whenever someone spoke to her. When they finally got inside their guest room Zaki reached out to give her a hug. But she flinched away, darted towards the washroom and has been there ever since.             

"She will be alright once she gets clean," he tells himself. Afterall no one would be in a talking mood, when they are covered in blood. Zaki remembers the last time he was covered in blood.

West Ixan was a place that made Zaki uncomfortable, because everyone would turn to look at him wherever he went. Sales people will follow him around as in the stores. Parents pulled their children a little closer when they passed by him. Women clunched her purses tighter when they stood next to him. It was as if the entirety of that side of the city is just waiting for him to cross the river back home. Today he had no choice, he came to drop off a replicated painting at the estate of a man who didn't know better. After his errand, he walked listlessly through the house with manicured lawns and regular sprintler schedules. He pass park with a playground and rested on a bench for awhile. It was an hour after schools let out, children are still playing with their friends before being picked up by their families. 

"Now we can't leave this nice bird a cripped can we?" said a man softly to his son. Zaki never thought he would hear that voice again.
He turned around to find a man with _, the face that haunted his dreams for years, a face he could not forget if he wanted to. The man who shot his mother square in the chest was picking his own son up from school, waving to a woman in the drvier seat of a car, who he assumed was his wife.

'He doesn't deserve a family,' Zaki thought. 'Not when he stole mine away.' He mentally takes down the car's license plate, and stands up to hurried home with purpose.

> How can we tap into Zaki's rage? What is it that he is feeling? envy
> determined to take away from Max's family from him. Can we dip into what manic envy means?

Lindell's was the biggest toy store in Ixan. Spanning 2 full blocks, it was designed 80 years ago by a the eccentric inventor Adam Douglas, who was the heir to his family's fortune. As a life long bachelor, having no family of his own, he poured his soul into making a magical place for the children of Galei. Children from the country side would demain a visit when their parents made excursions out into the city. The store was a miniature castle, compled with moats, towers, and secret passages. Inside it featured toys both antique and cutting edge. When you first entered, giant life sized stuffed animal will be there to welcome you. A giraffe guided your passage up the spiral stairwell onto the third floor. 

Zaki remembers going there as a child during summer school trips. He would get lost in a sea of toys, his family couldn't yet afford. His mother promised they will get him something from Lindell's one day, but that day never came. Today, it dawns that he can get himself something, but shopping is not the purpose of this visit.
