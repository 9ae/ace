# A Night Treader's Contract

`slam! door falls down`

`Vio standing at the entrance, wearing a butterfly shaped Venetican mask. Eyes in fugue state.`

`Everyone's head turns to her. Vio slashes her way down the table.`

Head: `wide eyed` is what they say about you true?

Vio: You're about to find out.

Head: Please, spare my

Vio: Now my clients won't be getting what they paid for if they did.

Head: `whimpers` No! not my!

Vio: Here's to your last day of fucking! `brings her blade down`

`show him with neck slicked and crouch bleeding`

`from the cupboard, a sob`

Boy: Please, I have a little sister. I'm the only one who can support her.

Vio: `Eyes return to normal. She brings her blade to his neck leaves the room with her cloak blown by the vents`

---

`The streets of Ixan are light by gaslight. Only other person out is a boy in shorts walking home with a violin case.`

[^7]: hint at trascendental philosophy

BC: You are risking exposure by letting him go.

Vio: But for him, it's just a job. And no one pays as well as one of the families. I can't orphan his sister.

BC: Does he even have a sister?

Vio: `pauses` maybe not. I never know if someone is lying.

BC: Because you always assume the best intentions

Vio: Because I can't visualize what someone's intentions may be. Not without you `reachs out of her hand`

BC: Intentions can't always be mapped out like patterns you find.

Vio: I know, that's why they are hard to understand.

BC: Well, if you were in his place. What would you do?

Vio: Think she'll kill me too. If tonight might be my last night, I might as well try my best to make it not so.

BC: Right

Vio: I'll try to slash my away out, what's the worst that can happen? She'll cut off my gentiles and watch be bleed to death.

BC: But if you were him and didn't have a weapon nor your fighting skills.

Vio: I'll try to use whatever means to survive. Maybe... even pled. Shameful it may be.

BC: You can't use your morals to how likely someone is going to act in a certain way. Because they don't have your morals. 

Vio: Right, I always forget that.

BC: At the end of the day, most creatures just want to make it until the next sunrise.

Vio: That's bleak, when the reason to live is just to live.

BC: I'll like to think some of us has more.

Vio: You're the only other person who belives that.

BC: Do I? You've never even the real me.

Vio: Yet, I feel like I know you. I can feel your essence, it's the same as mine.

BC: We prescribe purpose to the dark path we tread down.

`they had arrived at Vio's flat`

Vio: Thanks for walking me home.

Erik: Have I really walked? `lifts her chin up`

` and we see her street is empty, Vio walks up the stairs`

Vio: *I have conversations with people in my head. Run possible scenarios and what they would say. When they are gone the simulation remains.*

>  Bits of this scene is in storyboarder already

`Sicili's back is turned, we see her curls. It's a small flat, with everything in one room, parts sectioned off with curtains. There is one window in the entire apartment. By the window is a pot of basil in a cup-noodle.`

Sicili: `turns around` Vio! `looks down at her sister's clothes in dismay` Throw that in with the rest of your clothes to soak.

Vio: `holds up a penny romance serial` I picked up this for you. `Vio goes to change.`

Sicili: Oh! Did Prince Alec find out Swallow-tail is not his sister yet?!

`We see Vio's bare back with the tattoo`

Vio: Isn't his torment the reason you read this series? Why release the tension so soon?

`Sicili eats her breakfast, face buried in the book. The radio is playing.`

Radio: This morning mobsters were found dead in east bank inn. Some of them brutalized. The whole room painted in blood.

`Vio comes back out in white khaki. Sicili raises an eyebrow.`

Radio:  We wonder is the city's castrating killer at it again.

Vio: `scratches her head innocently` 

Sicili: You ought to be more discrete. We can't draw too much attention to ourselves. Remember we are here illegally.

Vio: Does it matter how they die?

Sicili: It does if it's usually violent. Homicides are rare in Galei, even rarer if it's this bloodly. Why not try poison?

Vio: Poisons are for ladies...

`A man drops dead in a lush room. Behind him is a silloutte of Zaki, holding a needle. The only thing that sticks out is the siringe and Zaki's transitional glasses.` 

Zaki: Vemon of a Y butterfly. It's a quick, but not necessarily painless end.[^103]

Zaki: You'll been reunited with your friends soon. `lowering down to touch the dead man's face` You can return tot he Earth together.

`Zaki stands up, and touches flower from the room. He reaches his finger towards a flower, bringing back nectar.`

Zaki: I wonder, `licks his moist fingers, that are thin and long.` What sweet nectars lay in the there after.

`The man continues to choke, as Zaki hides him behind the coach.`

`Lessa's silloutte appears behind the sheer veil. Startled Zaki jumps when she walks in, cracking a whip`

Lessa: Madame says you like the sting.

Zaki: `mouth hangs open` I uh..

Lessa: Sit down `pushes him to the coach`

`Zaki obeys. Lessa disrobes her kimono and saddles him. Running a long nail along his cheek.`

Lessa: Now tell me more about the things you like.

Zaki: `sucks in a breathe` I'd love to hear secrets. Why don't you tell me some.

Lessa: I like to take things that aren't mine.

Zaki: Sorry to disappoint, but my heart has been unclaimed. Now tell me about those you have taken.

Lessa: `draws a sharp hair pin` No, why don't you tell me who sent you.

Zaki: `smirks`

Lessa: No normal client will ask so many questions. This is not the type of talk session my services render.

`they trade blows. Zaki notices her tattoo. Just as Lessa is about to stab him with ther pin...`

Zaki : `jumps out the window`

Lessa: `about to follow him when she notices a deadman behind the coach`

`Zaki runs down the street and turns into a dark alley. He rips a piece of this clothing trying to stop the bleeding form the arm wound.  He presses his eyes closed. Street signs say Lorraine Lane, but this does not get mentioned anywhere else in the chapter.`

Zaki: No, it can't be.

FB: `a younger Zaki, watches a man with a sword kill his parents. The man has the same tattoo on his arm`

[^3]: What if it's the someone from the org who killed Zaki's parents? Instead of Vio's clan. It will make more sense on why Zaki had joined the rival org.

---

`Vio enters a clothing store, she chooses a blouse and brings it to the 3rd changing room. Pressing both hands into the mirror and stares intently at herself, in a few seconds she feels the mirror starts to slide. She steps back and the mirror continues to slide revealing an elevator. Ace steps in the into it and closes the gates. Shifting a lever the lift moves, this part of her commute has always makes her nervous so she counts. 1... 2...3...4... taking in a deep breathe she continues to count the levels as the elevator descents deep and deeper. She could see each level through the gates. They were all circular rooms, with the elevator shalf in the center, One was a training room, the other looked like a series of pop-up clinics, another was an armor. Each was lit with a different color lighting. As blue changed to violet, 7! She marked in her mind, she shifts the lever to a perpendicular angle and the elevator box stops. The door opens out into a locker room.`

`Helga is changing while other girls in the room are whispering about her`

Girl 2: Does she really think she's one of us?!

Girl 1: She doesn't belong here.

Helga `looks down and quickly puts on her bra.`

Vio: Just ignore them. They only say these things to scare you. If you show them it affects you not, they'll stop.

Helga:  I know. But it's hard to not feel. `smiles`

Vio: We are paid to not feel very much... especially around what we do.

Helga: That was in the night treader's contract?

Vio: No, but it's the only way to survive.

Girl 3: `walks up to them`

Vio: We don't want to hear whatever you have to say about Helga's womanhood.

Girl 3: No, your cousin is here.

`Lessa shows up at the entry way little bruised up`

Vio: Oh my. Does madam know?

Lessa: Yes, she is filing a report with Jacques now.

Vio: If being beat up is part of the job, you might as well join our team. At least we are allowed to hit back.

Lessa: No, it wasn't a client.
Or at least he wasn't my actual client. My actual client is dead.

Helga: What?![^101]

[^101]: Make this response more of an in word curse

Lessa: He found with his genitals stuffed in his mouth `raises her eyebrows at Vio`

Vio: You knew I had an assignment on the east side last night.

Rein: We'll actually he died of blood lost.

[^103]: Blood lost is not slow

`everyone turns to Rein, What is he doing in the girls locker room. Not that any of the girls minded`

Vio: And what was found in his blood?

Helga: `rolls eyes` There she goes with her apothocarey theory!

`The three of them stand in front of a board with lots of graphs and murder threads`

Vio: `enthusiasically explains` Over the past seven years, there has been approximately 1987 cases of death by poison. Which is a 400% increase in all of Ixan's history.

Helga: You can't really prove that!

Vio: No, because whoever is this poisoner is decided to cover her tracks very well.

Vio: Over the past seven years the use of cyanide poisoning has dropped drastically. `shows chart` Did people stop using poison? No. It's a fairly easy way to kill someone, and Galei becoming more chaotic as public services and institutions go private, you'll think there's higher demain for toxic chemicals.

The usage of toxins have not decreased, but whoever has taken over the market thrown investigation on off the deep end. You may have also noticed an increase in strange deaths over the past few years. 

Corpses found in rather perculiar situations? `show silloutte of man hanging from tower` For example last month a man was found on top the the construction crane in that new cathedral. When his friends and family were question they all mentioned he had a deadly fear of heights. The pathology reports say say he died of cardiac arrest. But did he really?

Lessa: What if he's just a sadistic bastard?

Vio: *She* might be, but there's something more. She's trying to say something. She has a reason, I feel like I can understand, even I don't know what it is. Rein, whats the substance found in Lessa's client blood?

Rein: _, it's a hemoglobin thinner, a rare chemical found only in the body of a Kuvarinni butterfly.

Vio: Exactly! What what the the butterfly apothecary frequently does to throw off investigation. There is no other species with the variety of deadly chemicals in their bodies as lepidoptera. And she that fact to throw of pathologist. But a few blood samples from those investigation have reported finding strange substances in their bodies, but since a decisvie cause of death has already been established no one ask why are those substances there in the first place.

Rein: `Pulls up a picture of the Kuravrinni butterfly` But it seems the Kurvarinni butterfly seems to be only found in the Atonian peninsula.

Vio: Interesting... because once the fluid leaves the butterfly's body it solidifies and no longer becomes effective after 3 days. And it's at least a week's travel between this city and even the northern border of Atonia.

Helga: So whoever made the poison must have made it here.

Lessa: Wait, I've seen that butterfly before!

Vio: You mean when we were young? They come to our estate in the spring all the time.

Lessa: No, I mean here! The botanical garden houses butterflies from all over the world.

`45 aerial view of the bridges and river, one of the bridges is wide, with levels and green houses and plants instead of vehicles, the sun is starting to set in the background.`

`Vio turns around in the garden. Show all the people and plants overwhelming her.` 

BC: `leaning down` Nice place for a date `Runs his hands down the stem of a rose. Of course there is no blood`

Vio: As if I'll ever have the chance

`Zaki looks up at them from his painting briefly, puts on his sun glasses with other people a walking around them.` (other people around too)

BC: `gets closer to her and says softly` we're here now... `brings his face up to hers` and the sun is about to set.

Vio: `closes her eyes` we're on a mission`Vio holds her nose, trying to focus on her surroundings`. Is this a place you come often?

BC: It is beautiful here `narrows eyes and looks into the sun`

Vio: To see the butterflies. You do love them don't you? Or you just use them?

BC: What answer would offer you the most comfort?

Vio: I'd like to believe you share a reverence towards them. But if you love them such, why would you use them.

BC: Why do you kill to survive. What if it's just a job like yours.

Vio: I knew you'll understand

`They walk into the butterfly exhibit`

BC: What an odd time to be wearing shades. `motions to Zaki`

Vio: Maybe he's blind... then I guess he won't be painting.

BC: Talk to him

Vio: About what?

BC: `shrugs` Start with complementing his painting. Artists open up if you love their work... they think you see into a piece of their soul...

Vio: What if it's ugly. I don't tell convincing lies.

BC: `leans into her ears` you lie to yourself all the time

`Vio turns to the painting, grasp in a heavy breathe`

Vio: That's *anything but ugly*

`It is a watercolor with flowers and bufferlies including X butterfly. While in in awed by the painting, BC scares Vio to lurch forward making her knock into Zaki, and red ink splatters all over it.`

`Zaki turns around, just as Vio falls on top of him.`
`The sun has started to set, and falls just a little below the horizon.`

> A few panels of wordless expressions

Vio: So... sorry, I ruined your painting

Zaki: It was already ruined. `picks up the watercolor paper and starts tearing it apart` the shadows have changed form when I first started his afternoon.

Vio: No one could tell. I liked it, especially those green and purple butterflies. 

Zaki: The Kuvarinni butterflies are quiet the beauty. Did you know after mating the male gives all his body's toxins to his mate? Next time a predator approaches him, he's food.

Vio: That's some bet he's making on her

Zaki: `smilies` He just knows she's the one when he sees her. "Love is

Both: sacrifice."

Vio: said the Hastuit poet, Pru. But can't he produce more toxin?

Zaki: The toxins in their bodies are from the seeds they ate as caterpillars. The amount of toxin he had before morphing is all he will ever have.

Vio: Then extracting toxins from them, are we....?

Zaki: `nods` hurt their chances of survivial.

Vio: My people used Kuvarinni poison all the time, I didn't know it would...

Zaki: You should take toxins from the pregnant butterflies. Since a female can mate and receive toxins multiple times in her life. It is a more sustainable to get them from her. But they must be careful, a pregnant butterfly is aggressive, one prick from her is lethal.

`Hold his finger up to a butterfly to a  land on`

Vio: You've got sweet fingers, for them to land on you like that.

Zaki: Haha, I like to keep them juicy. `wink`

Vio: `blinks` ummm *was that a joke I was suppose to understand? Why do people make jokes based on common knowledge. Why is it even assumed common knowledge!*

Zaki: `nods, started packing to leave.` Well, I need to get going. Thank you listening to be ramble.

Vio: My friends put up with my rambling too. Nice to know I'm not the only one.

Zaki: I'll like to learn what gets you excited. You're never alone as you think, _[^104].

[^104]: Zaki's nickname of Vio

`Vio catches him stealing a butterfly from the garden.`

`Zaki walks through the east Ixan, with Vio's silloutte following`

Erik: What a charmer.

Vio: He knows too much about X butterfly.

Erik: He's an artist, I'm sure he just appreciates their vibrant colors.

Vio: It's more than that. He also knows which butterflies to extract toxins from, so it doesn't kill them. Would an artist know that?

> Most of this scene will be silent, we want to focus on showing the world of east Ixan and a day in the life of Zaki

[^9]: It could be a good moment for Zaki to reveal something about himself that contracdicts Vio's belief of the type of person BC is

`Zaki goes get dinner. During it someone sit down in his table, it was the boy Vio had let go.`

Boy: `takes out a iridescent vial` Top quality as always. You heard of the products out in the market these days? Extracting toxins from the cacoons, those farms?

Zaki: I treat my providers with utmost care.

Guy: I know, that's what makes you the best in town. How are the experiments going?

`The waiter delivers Vio coffee, she drinks it without realizing there's grinds under it`

Zaki: I almost have a working solution. And I know just the place to test it in. *raises eyebrows*

Boy: Would you like one of my contacts in courier district?

`Zaki walks through the courier district, it's on the riverside near the docks.`

Narration: A little more than a year ago, Galei's postal service lost funding. In its collapsed private couriers sprung up. `city post office dark and with graffiti and trash`

`body guards outside many small shops`

Narration: Competition is fierce, and soon turned brutal. Each business tried to sabotage each other, to ruin their competitors reputation. Whoever knew mail deliver can be such a dangerous endeavor.

`Zaki enters a small stall. It's yellow and blue. Vio stops outside observing him. She couldn't make out waht he's saying. So the dialog comes out as blurry words. She does make out bits of the address, because the clerk repeats it back to Zaki. And also something about the impact radius.`

`The clerk ask Zaki something that makes him look around`

`Vio turns to a flyer when he turns in he direction. She picks it up`

Bodyguard: `comes up to Vio`. You're tiny, but it looks like you can pack some blows. `touches her arm`

Vio: `jumps away` Don't touch me, I'm not looking for a job.

Bodyguard: We pay in cahs. Our chief is available now if you want to come in for an interview. `leans in`

Vio: Now is not `reach for a knife`

Bodyguard: quick too, we could rally use someone like you.

Zaki: `pushes the body guard back` The lady said she's not interested.

`Vio looks up Zaki. They both have a split panel.` 

`Zaki at the top corner looks down with a smirk.`

Vio: `looking up, wide eyed` Damn.

`Vio & Zaki walking out into the docks`

[^10]: Vio doesn't realize he is BC yet and thinks he is just connected to her. Through this fight she finds out it is him, and the shock caught her off guard and made her lose the fight.

Vio: *He is butterfly collector, I just feel it.*

`Finally stopping near a ship`

Zaki: If you wanted to get to know me better, I could give you my number.

Vio: I don't make phone calls, butterfly collector.

Zaki: I can't help myself, they are beautiful creatures.

Vio: Beautifully deadly. `steps forward` Do you just make poison or do you administer them too?

Zaki: I'm more than happy to offer my services... `suggestive wink` Who do you want to drop dead?

Vio: Too many to be taken down by your needles.

Zaki: Well, soon _[^104]. I may have the ability to take out a whole room.

Vio: Last night, at the brothel of Madam Juliette Rosseau, who hired you to go there?

Zaki: Night Treader's Contract, clause 1, never reveal your clients.

Vio: `kicks forward` I know the rules.

Zaki: `ducks but trips` I see, you are one too.

Vio: Who were you working for _ three years ago?  `strikes again` Why did you kill Rein?

`She slices, but only hits a few strands of his hair`

Zaki: Clause 44, one question at a time. `perries and strikes at Vio` Who was Rein? Your late lover?

Vio: `Vio grabs his weapon, cuts herself a bit but pulls it out of him`  He was my mentor and you murdered him

`Vio pins him down at the right opporunity`

Zaki: Who do you know at the brothel? `raises eyebrows` a gentleman friend?

Vio: `pushes her knife down on him harder` I ask the questions

Zaki: A lady then. You know, everyone there deserves to fall under my needle?

Vio: `cries and punchs him, Zaki lets her` It is not your right to decide who lives and dies!

Zaki: Then who's right is it? The people who hire you?

`Just when it looks like Vio has bagged another win, Zaki tricks her and flips them over`

Zaki: This nation is descending into corruption. We can't guarantee there will be justice, lest we serve it ourselves. 

`Zaki injects Vio with a small dose of sleep draught`

`Vio wakes up in the morning at the docks. She picks up the locks of Zaki's hair and walks away from the rising sun.`

`Rein's sword slices through the air as Vio leans back on a duck. One her hand touches the ground she thrust her body forward to kick him in the chest. He stumbles back a bit. But catches her balance and shoves her legs to the ground`

[^11]: Image of the fake BC fades into Zaki (like TV static noise)
[^12]: What about Zaki's personality was very different from Vio's image of BC.

Rein: Let's rest.

Vio: No, I need to learn to be faster.

Rein: You lost a fight. That's part of the job, at least you made it out alive.

Vio: I could have easily not. Then what?! Who will take care of Sicili?!

Rein: If you go into a fight with that mindset, no wonder you lost.

Vio: I had him! `punches the ground` Your killer, I was so close.

Rein: Then what? What would you have done?

Vio: I... never thought I would one day find your killer.

Rein: Would you have killed him on my behalf?

Vio: You wouldn't have wanted that.

Rein: He had stuck a needle down my throat and counted my last breaths

Vio: No... I mean killing him won't bring you back.  If we go around killing people just because they have killed someone you love, there will be no one left in the world.

Rein: You make it sound like everyone is a murderer.

Vio: Anyone can be a killer under the right conditions. But it's not my place to make judgements on other people's lives.

Rein: Yet, you let others make the call for you. Dripping red it may be, but the sword will always be innocent.

Vio: *asked me a question I had been wondering myself.* Do you ever wonder about what we do?

Rein: If we didn't, someone else would. After all how else will you support your sister? We do what we must, some of us don't have the privilege to determine how we earn our keep.

Vio: I suppose, I don't neither.

Rein: Nor did he. When he stabbed me, he too was just fullfilling orders of his contract.

Vio: Then I will find out who signed the other line of his contract.

[^13]: What advice does the imaginary BC give when in her last moments that helps Vio win the fight with Zaki?

Rein: `steps behind her and guides her arm to hold her blade` Close your eyes. Now image you are someone looking from above at me and you. What do you see?

`perspective in the frontal of Vio`

Vio: You, guiding my blade. My hand bringing it to my neck.

Rein: That is how you must look at all fights, yes your body is a player. But you, yourself must now allow yourself to be in it.

Vio: ... what?

Rein: You must be the invisible eye ball. See but not be seen. Touch but not push. Observe without changing the environment, first before each move. That way you can see what your opponent sees.

Vio: `opens her eyes` don't use that crap on me. The Order are just bunch of power hungry zealots.

Rein: They may be. But you can't doubt the wisdom of the Lady Prophet's words. You feel too much. To feel, you would have already altered your perception of the fight. `takes Vio's hand again` Just observe. Separate your mind from your soul, and your soul from your body.

`pans out to see them, though fisheye`

Rein: `brings a knife to her back`

Vio: `grabs the wrist holding the knife`

---

[^14]: Org some new information not related to Zaki's backstory here gets revealed that makes her think he has scent something into Juliette's house.

Helga: By the way, I've found a matching record of those locks.
`opens the file` Zaki Attar, said to have went missing some years ago. Ever since they found his parents were dead from a lab explosion.

Vio: `grabs the file from Rein` What was a anthrololgy professor and a poetics scholar doing in the chemistry building?

Helga: That's what the investigation wondered about too. At the end they decided since they must have been refugee spies. Embedded to steal Galeian secrets. `nurses a paper cut` When social services went to collect their son, Zaki, he had disappeared.

Vio: Rudolf was the assistant working in the lab that night. Isn't he one of Juliette's boys?

Helga: I guess it was back when he was still at the academy.

Vio: `flashes back to what Zaki had said about the brothel` I don't think he was at Juliette's for a job. I think this is personal.
But he didn't find him that night, instead it was Lessa who showed up. `thinks about what Zaki said about a prototype` But this time he doesn't even need to be accurate.

Helga: What are you rambling about?

Vio: I think he's going to release some typoe of poisonous vapor onto Juliette's house!

`Juliette's house is a large Victorian mansion.`


> What is Vio feeling going into this scene? She is nervous because Zaki beat her once. Yet is is also angry and feels played. She goes in walls up and stakes out.

Vio: `to Juliette` Is that everyone, *madam*? 

Juliette: Thank you my sweet `reaches out to pat her on the cheek`

Vio: `flinches away`

Juliette: Oh sorry, I forgot.

Vio: *I can't stand being touched* `turns to Lessa` It turns out Zaki was after Rudolf. Did you trade shifts with him?

Lessa: In fact I did. Why is he after that sweet boy?

Vio: I don't know, but it will be nice if you can take some time off.

Juliette: Don't worry, Lessa will indeed be staying away from the Ritters. No amount of money is worth my girls getting hurt. So I am putting her on hazard pay. She won't be seeing any clients for a month.

Vio: `narrows eyes` oh, so this happens often.

Juliette: Not often, but I have money saved up for when it does. `leans in` see? working with me has way better benefits. You'll make an excellent intel agent if you ever decide to put down the blade.

Vio: Thanks but  I like my knives.

`Vio walks back to the house and in the study with the full length windows shining through.`

[^15]: What ends up lighting the place on fire?

`Zaki is standing there looking out the window and watch everyone leave in carriages.`

Vio: The vial you have delivered has been discarded and taken to our labs. I evaculated everyone.

`Zaki turns around to face Vio, the sunset from the large study paints her face. While he is in a shadows. He steps out to join her in the dusk light.`

Zaki: Pity, a house of ill reputate deserves it.

Vio: It is not your right to decide, Zaki Attar.

Zaki: `looks at her quizically` How? 

Vio: After they discovered your parents bodies. You were no where to be found.

Zaki: Well since I've been exposed. `takes out a curved blade` Only one of us will make it out of this house alive tonight.

`They start fighting`

Vio: Missing for nine years. Presumed dead.

Zaki: Dead? disappeared? Does it matter? I'm just another Hastuit boy lost into the debris of this crumbling city.

Vio: Yet your work for people who profit from each stoned removed from Ixan's foundation.

Zaki: `laughs` you think I have a choice. No, choice is a privledge dead orphans like me were never given. 

Vio: I understand that. My first kill was to save my sister and cousin. Not drawing the blade was never an option.

Zaki: If you hadn't killed then, you would have some other day. `steps closer` You're just like me. I understand `places hand on her` there's darkness inside you.
It calls, and it's our destiny to respond.

Vio: `snaps away his hand`  No. No one is born evil. 

Zaki: We're born with evil stitched in our hearts. And we don't look back when we tread down the dark path.

Vio: No, we have the power to exorcize evil. If given the chances. We can free people from the greedy clutches of the Order.
Eveyrone deserves a chance to make the right choices. Sorry you weren't given one. But it's not too late.

Zaki: Magical thinking, girl. `throws Vio down` I have long accepted myself as a killer and embraced the darkness within. You should too.

Vio: `crawls on the floor her eyes are about to go dark` No! `shakes her head` I will not!

Rein: The bomb is about to off `through her ear piece` Come out now!

`Vio thinks of the invisible eyeball. Closes her eyes. aerial view of the fight scene`

`Vio throws her knife near Zaki and misses. Then something tumbles and Zaki falls down a flight.`

`Vio climbs out and jumps on the back stairs of the Victorian. Rein and Helga are waiting outside.`

Rein: Did you find out the answers you were looking for?

Vio: No.

Rein: `places a hand of her shoulders` Sometimes there are no acceptable answers. Let's go before the police arrives.

Vio: Or I'm just not looking hard enough. `runs back into the house`
