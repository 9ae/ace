Pre
Ace kills off a table room of shady men

### theme: forgivness

### Outline

Pilot ideas:
- Ace and Helga is sent to protect Gretchen's opponents. This is the group of people who killed Zaki's parents. They suspect that Gretchen's family might be involved in the killing of the new radical party members, and pay Gretchen a visit. Helga and Gretchen hit it off. ... Ace realizes that this new radical party she is sworn to protect are actually really bad people, Zaki has planted a bomb in their estate. it blows up part of it, the wing Ace and Zaki are at is just on fire. Ace helps Zaki out of the wreckage.
- Ace gets hired by a wife who wants to see if her husband is still cheating on her (she is still primarily a spy). Zaki is hired as a body guard for her husband. Maybe we won't get introduced to Gretchen and Helga yet.
- After the previous PM dies, there's an election for the new PM. Edgar's people does not want there to be any challenge to their power, so they plant something incriminating to frame Gretchen's mom. Ace and Helga were assigned to protect Gretchen's family.
- Lesbia recently died and Ace thinks she was killed by Atonia lords targeting Alighieri survivors. Ace needs to find who ordered the assassination of Lesbia so she can end them before they get to Sicili. As she is trying to figure out this, she gets caught in the conflicts of Galei.
  - During convo with Sicili, she freaks out about doors being unlocked.
  - She has been getting info from tech team, and this leads her to Zaki

---

With the new turnover of power, the people who killed Zakiâ€™s family are making a comeback. He starts killing of the hit list of politicians. Ace encourages him to join the org, but he calls them a terrorist organization.

Ace and Zaki are on opposing sides of the case, at the end of the mission that get bloached she saves him, and they go back to his place.

It seems each chapter has a moral dilenma, what is it of the pilot?

---

In this room, there is an oblong table. Around it sits men in dark suits, some so dark they steal some light from this already dimly light room. At the end of the table furthest from the door is a man who's suit is so light absorbent that the men closer to him have to strain their pupils to see, when they look over to the other end of the table. At the other end is a figure, clothed in reflective black. 

She places one boot on the table, opens her arms like the wings of a plane. Both arms are given extentions by the aid of a dagger on each side. And like a plane in air she glides across the table, tilting, yawing to make sure her daggers come to meet the necks of each men. For it will be rude to greeting any one. When she gets to the end of the table, she smiles. She does not cut his throat, no for the man who's presence steals light, she's got something special. She returns one of her daggers to its hostler, and brings her free hand to meet her other. With both hands on the handle, she bares her teeth in a wide grin. "Here's to your last days of fucking!" she declares and she brings the dagger down onto him.

---

The girl in the reflective black steps out into the night. Unraveling the cobblestone paved maze, she make her way back home. And she makes it up the final set of steps leading to her flat, she can smell the aroma of tomatoes and spices.

"Vio! You're home!" her younger sister greets her.

"Dinner smells fabulous, Sicili. Thank you." Vio saids she she close the door. As she makes her way to take a closer look at tonight's meal, Sicili stops her.

"Nah-uh, we are not having blood in our pasta sauce tonight. Go wash up, it should all be ready when you get out," Sicili commands.



Vio and Sicli sit around coffee table in their small flat, as they eat and watch the evening news.

"The investigation about the mysterious sum of money that appeared in Justice Marlies Ritter's office is continues," declared the reporter. "Where did the money come from? Is our country's most respectable judge taking bribes?" The news reels back to footage with a woman with a blonde bob, making her way through the paparazzi. "She refuses to comment, stating her personal finances are her business. But can you have personal business, when you are the most popular political figure of our country?"

"They really can't think of putting her on trail can they? She's the reason Edgar von Essen got elected last term." asked Sicili.

"Galei is not like Atonia, here law is law. It doesn't matter if you put our prime minister in power." reflected Vio.

"Do you miss home?" purposed Sicili.

"How can I miss home, when I've got the best Atonian chef right here?!" Vio curls the spaghetti around her fork to take an enthusiastic bite.

---

Vio enters a clothing store, she chooses a blouse and brings it to the 3rd changing room. Pressing both hands into the mirror and stares intently at herself, in a few seconds she feels the mirror starts to slide. She steps back and the mirror continues to slide revealing an elevator. Ace steps in the into it and closes the gates. Shifting a lever the lift moves, this part of her commute has always makes her nervous so she counts. 1... 2...3...4... taking in a deep breathe she continues to count the levels as the elevator descents deep and deeper. She could see each level through the gates. They were all circular rooms, with the elevator shalf in the center, One was a training room, the other looked like a series of pop-up clinics, another was an armor. Each was lit with a different color lighting. As blue changed to violet, 7! She marked in her mind, she shifts the lever to a perpendicular angle and the elevator box stops. 

Walking out into a room that filled with glass screens with writing scribbled all over them and projections on the wall, maps, charts, and a few was live feeds offices some with people milling about, and other empty. A small assembly gathered around a set of screens with the same woman, she and Sicili saw tonight during dinner. 

"Marlies Ritter II, has been in the political space for over 20 years. From a small town judge, beloved by citizens to one of the most game changing Justice Galei has ever known," saids Ace's boss, Jacques.

Jacques is a stern man, everything about him was sharp. His nose was like a cliff that fell into stark eyes. He was like someone drawn by an artist who's carcoal couldn't make turns, all angle and lines. The one soft feature was his hair, with bangs that curved around his forehead in sweeps of light brown and grays.

"Do they suspect she was buying support to get elected as Justice?" asked Ace directly, because she suspected that's where these allegations about Justice Ritter were leading to.

"Yes, possibly or it could be going somewhere else? Or someone framed her," Jacques suggested. "When you have been so popular for so long, you've bound to be making a few silent enemies."

"Could it have anything to do with helping someone in her family out?" suggested Ace.

 "All her family has a larger bank account than her," saids Helga.

Helga tall blonde, with a ponytail tied to one side. Strapped upon her broad shoulders is a long rifle and a broad sword, they both made a vertically stretched assertive X across her back. The small of her back peaked through her white crop top, on her skin cursive ink snaked their way to hide below the rise of her jean shorts. She rocked from heel to toe in her ankle boots rhythmically. 

"Her husband is the retired Cellean actor, Pierre d'Acoust" Helga continues "the land her parents own in Ivonne yields more monthly than her salary year's salary."

"Someone reads the gossip pages," Jacques teases.

"What?! The Ritter - d'Acoust family are such figures in Galei, you don't have to be a tabloid chaser to know. Especially with how frequently d'Acoust had been found having affairs." explains Helga

"He handsome husband of Galei's longest standing politician, hard to not take advantage of that", reflects Ace in what she hoped is correctly heard as a sarcastic tone. Sarcasm has always been the hardest humor for her to comprehend and deal. Irony on the other hand, now that is her fine art.

"Well you girls better watch out for yourselves around him, because I promised Justice Ritter to send you two over tomorrow morning to help her figure out how she got framed," Jacques announces.

Helga's eyes lit up with stars, "You mean, I will get meet Marlies Ritter?!"

---

The Justice's home in the city was humble. In a quiet street lined with trees, they entered a townhouse. The butler lead them a few flight of stairs into the drawing room. Where a family of three awaits them. Marlies Ritter stands a up to greet them. She is a woman in her late 50s, with blonde hair fading to white cut in a puffy short bob. She is wearing an ivory white blazer over a periwrinkle silk blouse and light tan slacks. Helga never expected for this woman of such great political influence to be barely taller than her breast.

With Helga still a bit star struck, Ace took the responsibility of introductions. "Nice to meet you Justice Ritter. I am Agent Ace and my partner on this case Agent Helga."

Marlies Ritter shakes their hands firmly. "I'm sure you all know of Pierre, and this is my brilliant daughter Gretchen. She recently got elected counsel woman in district 8."

Gretchen, a young girl around their age with strawberry blonde hair and large brown eyes saids, "Mother, you are that's such a small seat."

"Nonsense! Every step counts, and should be celebrated!" said Marlies. Ace can't help to feel a tinge of jealously towards Gretchen, for having a mother that is proud of her achievements. 

Marlies's husband cleared his throat, "we asked you here today because since her first day in office, Gretchen has mysterious death threats."

"We suspect, they are because I've been researching President von Essen," Marlies explains.

"Research?" asks Ace.

"I've worked with him for many years, but within the last two years he seems different," Marlies explains. "His mood is irregular, so maybe he has dementia. But also he never seems to be without the company of a Counsel member, I wonder if the Royal Council has something over him and is using that as blackmail to control him."

"Now that you've mention it," starts Helga. "I've noticed change too. Last week, when a reporter asked him about the rising rates of homeless citizens in Ixan, he socked the guy in the eye with his own mic!"

"We think, someone must know about mom's investigation and to scare us to get her to stop by sending me death threats," says Gretchen.

"Are you sure this is related?" asks Ace. "Could it be your campaign opponents being grumpy that you own? After all you only started receiving these threats after you got elected."

"That too is possible," Marlies's husband speculates. "Whatever is the source, we hired you two to guard out daughter. They say, you two are the best assassins in the city, the Eagle and the Viper. If someone was trying to get Gretchen, you'll know their mind."

Helga kneels in front of Marlies, and crosses their right hand to touch her left chest. "Your daughter is safe with us, Justice."

Ace is shocked as this level of formality is not customary in Ixan's classless society. She guess Helga still has a bit of the dismantled noble discipline drilled in her. Not wanting to seem rude for just awkwardly standing there, she follows suit to also bow to Marlies.

> What do they do?
>
> It shouldn't be some random stuff, it should move the plot of the story forward, just that the audience and characters does not know it yet. 
>
> **Ace should also take a more active role.** Since she came from a loose rules oligarchy, the whole government structure of Galei amazes her. But at this point the readers don't know that yet. What would explain her curiosity instead of using it as an excuse to info dump?
>
> Have her reflect on the questions back, "do you mean...", "if _, then will _?" What if I have her ask questions in the vein of questions we may have about our government structure?

The next morning the arrive at the Ritter's at 6:00am, which for two assassins was normally bedtime.

"Do you have trouble falling asleep last night?" asks Ace.

"I went for a jog, lifted some weights, then did 100 push ups. After that, I was wiped!" explains Helga, motioning with her hand wiping her forehead.

Ace blinks her eyes slowly, it seems she might have tuned out of the conversation a few moments ago.  Helga sighs, "why do rich people always insist on getting up before the sun rises."

"So no one can see their evil deeds," saids Ace.

Bright eyed and alert, Gretchen blond hair tied in a ponytail sways back and forth as bounces down the stairs with a laptop bag over one shoulder, handbag on her  elbow and two large mugs with a cap on them in her hand.

Helga rolls her eyes, "Gawd! does she really need two cups, no wonder she's so cheerful, she's clearly an addict."

When Gretchen comes out the front door and hands Ace and Helga each a mug.

"Would you like us to carry it for you?" asks Helga dryly.

"I'll like for you to drink it," says Gretchen in almost a command, then soften her voice "if coffee is your thing."

Helga takes a tentative sip, as she and Ace follow Gretchen to her office.

> Or we can catch her in the morning errands first to take a tour around town

The workplace of a councilwoman like an avery. If the birds were phones, one staff member run from the xenofax room with such urgent fervor that he almost knocked the cup coffee off Ace's hands. "Miss Ritter, _ Rep of Aquadynamics wants to know when his petition to _ be approved."

"We'll have to inform him that he will not. They want to reroute the stream from 4 neighborhoods to the factory," answers Gretchen.

"But, they said construction for the expansion begins next week," explains her staff member.

"Well Aquadynamics will have to set up an another water supply for these neighborhoods themselves," says Gretchen.

"Great! I'll tell them that..."

"No! I mean..." but has already rushed off to his desk. Gretchen excuses herself from Helga and Ace to clarify sarcasm to him.

Ace scans the room, inspecting ever member of the District 29's staff. They say disgruntle employees are likely to target their boss. So everyone in this room is a likely suspect for Gretchen's latest death threats. While all the employees seem stressed, Ace is not sure how much of that is working for Gretchen or just a factor of working in an understaffed civil service office. Galei's government  had to declare bankruptcy  several times over the past decade, and each time cut the budget for government staff, especially local government positions. 

As if almost reading her thoughts, Helga ask quietly "do you think the person we are looking for is in this room?"

"No one seems to stand out as an obvious suspect, but I won't rule anyone out just yet."

When Gretchen returned she lead them to her office, which just was a small room annexed from the staff desks, its only window looked out into the main office. 

"We would like some time to talk to each one of your staff," says Helga.

"What for?" demands Gretchen. "My people are busy, can't you see?!"

"We'll they'll be busier if you get killed." said Helga.

"If I die, they'll probably just merge District 29 into 28." speculates Gretchen. "There's been so much talk about merging Ixan districts. You know, to cut expenses?"

"Well, we're not going to let that happen." said Ace. "The people obviously wanted you, not _ of 28. So it's your obligation to continue representing them, so at least try cooperating with us in keeping you alive?!"

"Fine," said Gretchen. "But no more than 30 minutes a person, we all have an ever growing mountain of work to do."

> Gretchen takes meetings with business owners, and one person who wants to file a lawsuit against their company. 
>
> **Gretchen flirts with Helga, what is their romance dynamic like?**
>
> If Gretchen is forward and sly like Bobby, how would the straight forward Helga respond? softly laugh?
>
> Then they find Zaki sneaking out of Gretchen's office. **Ace tails Zaki leaving Helga to protect Gretchen**
>
> Lots of parallels can be drawn here:

>
> How can we compare and contrast the lives of Gretchen very public v Zaki very secretive? We catch Zaki leaving Gretchen's office towards the end of the workday, and it is the evening in which Ace is tailing Zaki. Both Ace and Zaki are creatures of the night.

> Communication style. Gretchen comes on to Helga very directly, she knows what she wants, and she is going to get it. Oh maybe I can draw from the episode Wesley pretends to be Angel and has to protect a wizard's daughter. 



After questioning the last of Gretchen's staff in their make shift interrogation room, Ace and Helga set up in the pantry, it was past work hours. Everyone had gone home. Gretchen was still working ofcourse, but she was board meeting in a meeting with _, which they were not allowed to follow her into. As they walked down the hall back to District 29's office space, someone shut Gretchen's door closed, and walked in the opposite direction down the hall.

He was definitely not one of Gretchen's staff they had talked to today. From the distance, they could make out he was wearing a long black coat, and wore small tinted glasses. '*Who wears sun glasses at night, inside?*' Ace wonders. As he passes the elevators and takes the stairs instead, she turns to Helga. "You stay with Gretchen after her meeting."

"You're gonna leave me with butt tight blonde?" says Helga.

"I'm going to find out who takes the stairs down from the 23rd floor."

---

Ace jumps into the elevator, and goes down to the lobby. She positions herself in an enclave from the door of the stairwell. 

For Ace blends herself in with the evening pedestrians of the city. Tailing a few paces behind the man who wears tinted eyewear after sunset. He walked through the streets as a shadow, both of his hands tucked into the pockets of his trench coat. 

As the man approaches the river, the pedestrians in the streets thin down. Ixan is splintered by a river, back in the prosperous decades shipments would run from the north produced by the factories around the country. Trade ships would carry weapons and explosives out south to other neighboring countries. But over the past decade, as demand for weapons slowed down, and so has the boat traffic. Now the river has nothing but a few boats docked on their piers. Some of the piers are converted into parks. 

He stop at one of the parks, this one has small garden with lilies and orchids. The white lilies fill the air with a brisk medicinal odor. The walks up to an row of orchids. Vio hides behind a rose bush. He holds his left hand to an orchid, rubbing a little bit of nectar onto his fingers. The twilight breeze has cleared out every droplet of evaporation from the sky; it is a cloudless night. Reaching his pointer finger to the sky, he traces the dots forming the bull constellation. A butterfly lands on his ring finger to get a taste of the nectar. It is a _, rare to find in these parts of the country. They normally live in more moist climates. He wonders what brought it so far, has it also been escaping from a war torn home like so many people in this city. Very carefully, he pricks its body with a needle, and the butterfly freezes in place, as its wing is in full span. He catches it with my hand as it falls from my finger. Taking a small box from his shoulder bag, he places the butterfly into it. He leaves the park to walk to one of the draw bridges to the east side.

Before following him, Vio pages Helga to look into butterfly toxins. She knows many of them contain chemicals that have neurological effects on humans. Harvesting butterflies for their toxins have been made illegal decades ago in Galei. But she won't be surprised if there was a black market for it.

He finally removes his sunglasses, when he walks into an art supplies depot. Not wanting to seem too obvious that she is following him, Vio waits for a few other patrons to go in. She wonders if he was aware of her and is he using this an opportunity to lose her. She tries to keep him in sight through the glass doors. Once she walks in she quickly scans through the isles searching for the man, and found him the ceramics section. He was carefully looking at sculpting knives, picking some up to test their tips against the pads of his fingers.

She picks up two blocks of clay, from a shelf at the end of the isle. Practicing the worlds she is about to say in her head over and over again, and even whispering them to herself a few times. A few customers looks at her suspiciously. Bracing herself to start a conversation, she walks up to the man no longer wearing sunglasses at night.

> What would Zaki's reaction be to this situation? If a random stranger came up to ask him for help, but seems like they are not genuine? Does he suspect?
> 

"Excuse me," she says. As he looks up from the sculpting tools, she draws her face into the meek smile, Sicili often uses. "Do you know which of these clays is better for making miniatures?"

The man looks up. He seems only a few years older than her, messy shoulder length black hair, with bangs partially obscuring his deeply set purple eyes. Reaching out his hand, he says softly, "let me see?"

Vio quickly set them on his palm. He rolled each around his long and thin fingers. "This one firing clay, mostly used for pottery, and this one is just molding clay." He hands both back to her.

"Oh," says Vio embarrassed she came up with such an dumb excuse question. He must suspect her now. No one in this specialty store would be ignorant mistake. Maybe she should bolt now?

"If you are looking make small things," he reaches for a shelf above her head. As he towers over her, she recognizes the scent of eucalyptus. "Here, I think this will do, it air dries over a few days. Or if you are feeling impatient 15 minutes in the oven will get it to harden." he hands her a blue clay block.

"Thank you," she mutters.

"No problem, what are you trying to make?" he ask.

> Need specifics, maybe he is suspicious.

"Umm... uh.... It's for a friend!" Vio finally come sup with an answer. "I'm just getting supplies for him, because... he can't now."

> Zaki needs personality. This is the first scene he speaks, so far with the tailiing we have built enough mystery to make him a potentially interesting character. But his actual introduction falls short. 

"Oh, I  see," he says, getting ready to turn back to examining the knives.

"He's in surgery!" she continues, not realizing she no longer needs to feed more details into this lie. "For rectum cancer! Haha, yea. He'll be horizontal for weeks."

"Is it risky?" he asks.

"What?"

"The surgery. If he might not make it out alive, maybe you shouldn't waste your money to get him supplies. You want to make sure he'll be there to use it," he explained.

> Is this too much?

Having been caught up in her own story, she punches him in the face. "My friend might die! A few dollars on _, isn't something to be calculating about." She says anger swelling up inside her to be release through a hot burst of tears.

"Geez, I was just joking," he says. Blood starts to trickle down his nose. Once again she failed to distinguish between a joke and straight talk. 

She quickly grabs a sponge, "Here, sorry you voiced my fear pretty well... and I got worked up."

He nods eager to no longer engage in further interaction with this violent girl. "You should find yourself someone to talk to about these feelings. I heard there was a new doctor around, studying hysterical women."

"He's a pervert."

"Hey, just saying. I have to go, miss." he says.

Vio stops him, and he holds his arms up to his face, ready to defend himself for another blow. But instead of punch, she hands him five dollars. "For the sponge."

"Thanks," he says as he continues to back away. Afraid to turn around and walk forward, he backs into a shelf of brushes, knocking a few over.

After he is gone, Vio takes tape from her bag. She rips up a few pieces, and lifts his finger prints from the clay blocks.

---

(scene to draw) Ace holds a Zaki`s fingerprints.

"So this friend of yours, can find us anyone?" Ace asks breathlessly as she and Helga hiked up the hills in the outskirts of Ixan.

"He is the best hacker in Ixan, and his sister the greatest algorithm inventor if there's no path to the solution, she'll forge one. But I should warn you... he's a bit eccentric." says Helga.

"How so?"

"Well, he ..." Helga gets cut off as a man sprints in between them muttering "I'm late, I'm late, she's gonna kill me".

"He's right there," Helga saids pointing to the main who rudely cut in between them. "Hey, Alan wait up!" she calls out jogging up to catch up with him.

Alan turns around, "Hey Helgirl! What are you doing all the way out here?" He has started to jog backwards as he is talking to them.

"We're here to see you," Helga catches up and they both stop in front of a faded green garage door, but instead of it being attached to a garage, it was on the foot of a high hill.

When Ace finally caught up, the back of her shirt was wet from running uphill felt embarrassed about it, but realize her sweat was nothing compared to Alan's completely soaked through shirt. The collarless short sleeve shirt hung to his skin, and a purple skin tie held his shorts up as if they were a belt.

"Well, stop loitering in front of our lab door. Com'on in!" Alan motions them snapping his fingers as the garage door opens up at his command. 

"How do you do that?"  Ace ask Alan with curious fascination as if he had performed a magic trick, for all she knew it might as well have been magic. 

Alan smirks, "family secret"

They walk through a tunnel, light with bioluminscent algae feeding on the rocks. When they approached an opening, it was floooded with harsh worker lights.

One side is filled with giant auto parts, another with several computer system setups. In a corner is a kitchennette with a counter table and a pot of steeping tea. A Hanon boy with glasses, and stiff dress shirt came with a cup of tea to greet them.

"Yihan!" Helga greets him. "How have you been?"

"Uh... fine I guess," he says. "Would you like some tea? We got a fresh shipment from Tsuon."

"Tsuon?" Helga ask. "Isn't there a blockaged by the Order along the dessert trade route?"

"We have our ways," Yihan says with wink.

"Where's Ada?" Alan asks.

"Your sister's went out to get more solder," Yihan answers.

"Again?", Alan says with an eyebrow raised. "How many times do I have to tell her solder is for connecting circuits and not building animal miniatures!" He leads them to take a seat near one of the work stations.

Vio hands him the tape with the man's fingerprint she had lifted from the clay, he throws it into a small black box. And when it's closed beams on light scans the tape, and the image of this fingerprint appears on the monitor screen. Yihan appears behind them with two blocks of tea.

"So are you in the security research divison with Alan?" Vio ask Yihan.

"Yea, except Ada and I do more field work while Alan just sits on his ass all day." Yihan says mockingly at Alan.

"Well this ass, can tell you that you've meet with a dead man." Alan turns around to show them the person identified with the fingerprint. They all turn to look the screen.

"Zaki Attar, hasn't been seen in almost a decade." Alan reads from the profile, "he went missing after his parents were found dead in their house."

"Oh my," Helga says taking a sip of her tea. "We have a lot of dead people walking in this city."

---

Scene: When they find Zaki.

> How did they end up here? Gretchen's parents got exiled left in a hurry and forgot to pay them. She texts Helga and Ace to meet here at their house so she can pay them. Helga is excited at the possibility having another chance with Gretchen.

"I did not ask you to come, because I want to see you," Gretchen explains first thing when they walk into Marlies' study. Helga's hopeful smile fell. Gretchen stands over a large semi-circle desk by the window. She did not bother to turn around to face Vio and Helga.

"But the case is over. So why did you call us to meet you?" ask Vio.

"You're right. My parents left in a hurry," she finally turns around holding out a large envelop to Vio. "And they forgot to pay you." Gretchen's entire figure rigidly postured to avoid looking at Helga at all. She is so intently focus on Vio that Vio couldn't help to feel awkward.

Too afraid to make eye-contact, Vio takes the envelope and mutters thank you. 

"No, thank you two for protecting me," says Gretchen. From down the hall they hear a loud thunk. "I thought all our staff had already went home." The three women go out to check it out. When they walked through the door, Gretchen's arm brushes against Helga. They finally look at each other, and put excess distance between each other. 

From the end of the hallway, a tall figure in a dark trench coat stands up. It was the man Vio had followed, Zaki Attar. Dusk sprinkled on his trenchcoat has it seems that he came from the attic trap door. He was still kneeling on the ground when they found him. Aware that there are people who have seen him, he slowly stands up turning to face them. His gaze stops at Vio, recognizing her from the art supply shop, he smirks. "How was your friend's butt surgery?"

Instead of answering, Vio draws out a knife from her thigh strap. Following suit Helga cocks her revolver.

"Wow, is that how you treat your guest?!" mocks Zaki as he too draws out a curved knife from his coat.

"This is my parent's house, and I am pretty sure you are uninvited here just like you were in my office." Gretchen declares. As the only unarmed person, she takes a step forward. "Who are you? And why are you sneaking around in your residences?"

Helga takes a few steps forward too, making sure her gun is pointed at Zaki's knife welding shoulder. 

"I'm just a resident of this city, just trying to get by," Zaki explains.

"By doing Edgar's dirty work," says Gretchen.

"We know you you are, Zaki Attar." says Helga. "21 years old, son of deceased _ Attar and _. No one had seen you for a few years after your parent's body was found slattered in their house. No one has seen you since, you were persumed dead."

"Well, I see you ladies are well acquinted with my past. Yet, other than little miss presidential advisor here," he motions at Gretchen. "I don't know who you are. Can I at least get your names?" He turns to make eye contract with Vio and winks, "and maybe your number?"

"They call me Ace." says Vio as she lunges towards him. He blocks just him time with his own knife.

> Fight scene in this dialogue.

"We really don't have time for a tumble right now," says Zaki.

"Sorry, I don't take rain checks on slicing up sneaky snakes." demands Vio.

"There's a bomb planted in the basement of this house!" says Zaki.

"Ha! And you know because?"

"I was the one who planted it!" he explains. "Yes, I took a gig from Edgar. He thinks the Ritters have got some dirt on him and he wants them out."

"So you aren't here to clean the attic gutters," says Vio.

"I was told to plant a bomb just in case, we need to restort for more drastic measures. But now that the Ritter's are out, there's no need. I came here to deactivate it."

"How chivarous of you," says Vio as she disarms him, catching his curved blade in the air. She lunges her own knife towards his throat.

"This was just another job for me," he says with her knife's tip at his Adam's apple . "No one needs to die."

"Maybe he telling the truth," suggests Gretchen.

"Only one way to find out," says Helga and she pulls out a coord of ropes. Zaki describes the location of the bomb and how to deactivate it, which seemd to involve a complicated procedure, even if they knew which wires to cut. 

As they go down the stairs, Gretchen ask "did he say to cut the blue wire after yellow wire or after the brown wire?"

"Yellow," says Helga and "Brown" says Vio simutaneously.

"Let's hope it makes more sense when we see it," Gretchen says hopefully. When they finally find the bomb their task did not seem easier. It was a tangle of wires, they could barely see the colors in the dim lighting. And they had only 40 seconds left before it activates. 

"I'll try my best," says Vio as she takes out a pocketknife.

"No, we don't have time. We've gotta get out of here!" says Gretchen.

Just then they heard a loud crash, Helga had smashed a large _ through one of the windows. "Com'on let's go," she saids with an hand outstretched towards them. Gretchen takes it, and the three of time climb out of the basement window. As soon as they are out they sprint as away as fast as they can. Hiding behind a stone statue of the Prophet Lady Lygeia, as the bomb in the basement goes off and the Ritter household is becomes engulfed by flames.

The girls slowly stand up watching the house burn, Gretchen tiptoes to plant a kiss directly on Helga's lips. "Thank you for saving me."

Helga looks absolutely stunned, especially since Gretchen's last words to here was she never wanted to see her again. "You're forgiving me?"

Gretchen shakes her head, "Forgiveness is comes from empathizing with the mistakes one makes. I don't understand why you did what you did yet."

Helga looks bewilderingly at Gretchen. Gretchen continues taking the other blonde's hand. "But if I close the door on you now, then I may never understand." Then looking directly up into her eyes she says, "Someday I want to understand. You."

Helga leans in towards Gretchen's face, and they both lean into eachother for another kiss. This one was not just a peck. When it they finally pull apart, Vio's expression changes from confused to resolved. She runs towards the burning house.

"What are you doing?!" Helga screams after her, but she kept on running and Gretchen held on to Helga to prevent her from following her partner.

With the main entrance collapsing, Vio goes through the back patio's sliding doors. She crawls through the smoke up the stairs where they had tied Zaki to a banister, only to find he a broken free of the constraints. When she finally found him, he was collapsed on the ground with a beam that had fallen on his chest. She wish Helga was here as she lifts the beam, she wasn't as strong as the other girl.

She checked his pause, he was still alive. She lifts him up, slings one of his arms against her shoulders, with her own hand wrapping around his back, they make their way back to the exit. He let out a few dry coughs and looks up at her with half open lids. "Why are you doing this?" he mutters.

"There has to be a reason you stayed dead, to stay alive." she says. "Let's not make your record status your actual status."

"But I..." he starts.

"You were just doing your job," she says. "No one deserves to die on the job, you obviously have something to live for."

"What about you?" he ask.

She takes a moment and thinks of her sister, "yes I do." They when they finally escape the Ritter household, she notices that Helga had sent a message to her pager. "I'll send for reinforcements."

"No need. We're fine," she types back.

Vio carries the trench coat figure up a long flight of spiral stairs. "So what floor are you on?" she ask. He didn't answer, "Zaki?" she nudged him again. He finally looks up a her, obviously dazed.

"Is that what you still go by? What do people call you now?" she ask.

He finally replies, "For a while, I was alone. No one called me anything."

"Me too," she says.

"Zaki is fine, my mom was the last person to call me that," he tells her. "I live on the top floor."

She looks up the spiral and sighs, they have a long way to go. When they finally arrived at the very top, there was no other units on the floor. He lived in the attic of the complex, the entire place smells of turpentine. Canvases with partially finished paintings laying out to dry along the floors. A large semicular window from the opposite wall lit the place with a dim blue night. That was when she notices the butterflies; along all the walls are are glasses cases of taxodermied butterflies of all species and breeds. Their wings splays out like watchful eyes on the guest as  they limp their way to the bed.
