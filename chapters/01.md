# Themes:

- What's Vio's internal conflict?
- How does Zaki challenge it?
- What's Vio's weakness, how does she overcome it by the end of the chapter to win against Zaki?

Head: Rossi?

M1: Gone, and his family too.

Head: Perfect.

`slam! door falls down`

`Vio standing at the entrance, wearing a butterfly shaped Venetican mask.`

`Everyone's head turns to her. Vio slashes her way down the table.`

Head: `wide eyed` is what they say about you true?

Vio: You're about to find out.

Head: Please, spare my

Vio: Now my clients won't be getting what they paid for if they did.

Head: `whimpers` No! not my!

Vio: Here's to your last day of fucking! `brings her blade down`

`show him with neck slicked and crouch bleeding`

`from the cupboard, a sob`

Boy: Please, I have a baby sister. I'm the only one who can support her.

Vio: `brings her blade to his neck`

Vio: If you ever speak about tonight, I can promise you, you're last days will feel like eternity. `leaves the room with her cloak blown by the vents`

`The streets of Ixan are light by gaslight. Only other person out is a boy in shorts walking home with a violin case.`

Erik: You are risking exposure by letting him go.

Vio: But for him, it's just a job. And no one pays as well as one of the families. I can't orphan his sister.

Erik: Does he even have a baby sister?

Vio: `pauses` maybe not. But he doesn't seem like someone who deserves to die.

Erik: You are now the judge of who has the right to live?

Vio: I ...

Erik: Have surrendered that decision to those who paid you to kill.

Erik: I don't understand this place. In the mountains, life was simply. Survive, protect your tribe. If another tribe kills your loved one, it is your responsibility to repay the deed.

Vio: `smiles` I miss the mountains `reaches to hold Erik's hand`

Erik: Here? What does justice event mean? When right to be right belongs to those who can buy enforcement.

Vio: I know I am not carrying out justice for anyone. I'm just trying to support my little sister too. `looks down at her bloody hands` After all, what else am I good for.

Erik: You've got to stop seeing yourself only by the things you can do.

Vio: No one wants me other for anything else other than what I can do for them.

Erik: Our tribe welcomed you, because of your spirit not for your half trained fighting skills.

Vio: But no one else. Your tribe, the only place I could be myself, the only place I belonged, is no more.

Erik: `looks into the sky` the falcons are not just a collection of mountain nomads. Even disbanded, we'll always be falcons.

`they had arrived at Vio's flat`

Vio: Thank you for walking me home.

Erik: hey, what else can I be doing?

`Vio turns the key into her flat, and we see her hallways is empty`

Bits of this scene is in storyboarder already

`Sicili's back is turned, we see her curls. It's a small flat, with everything in one room, parts sectioned off with curtains. There is one window in the entire apartment. By the window is a pot of basil in a cup-noodle.`

Sicili: `turns around` Vio! `runs up to Vio with food a container and stuffs a sandwich in her mouth` Clean up!

`This is the first time we here the MC's name`

Vio: What?

Sicili: It's cousin, she's in the hospital.

Vio: `thinks turns angry` Did one of her clients...

`Vio runs off to change`

Sicili: We'll find out when we get there.

`Sicili eats her sandwich while the radio is playing`

Radio: This morning mobsters were found dead in east bank inn. Some of them brutalized. The whole room painted with blood.

`Vio comes back out in white khaki. Sicili raises an eyebrow.`

Radio:  We wonder is the city's castrating assassin at it again.

Vio: `scratches her head innocently` 

Sicili: You ought to be more conventional. We shouldn't be drawing too much attention to ourselves. Remember we are here illegally.

Vio: Does it matter how they die?

Sicili: It does if it's usually violent. Homicides are rare in Galei, even rarer if it's this bloodly. Why not try poison?

Vio: Poisons are for ladies...

`A man drops dead in a greenhouse. Behind him is a silloutte of Zaki, holding a needle. The only thing that sticks out is the siringe and Zaki's transitional glasses.` 

Zaki: Vemon of a Y butterfly. It's a quick, but not necessarily painless end. 

`The man continues to choke, as Zaki walks around the green house.`

Zaki: You'll been reunited with your friends soon. In fact, Mr. Ritter should be waiting for you at the gate. `lowering down to touch the dead man's face` You two can walk through together.

`Zaki stands up, and clips a few flowers from the green house. He reaches his finger towards a flower, bringing back nectar.`

Zaki: I wonder, `licks his moist fingers, that are thin and long.` What sweet nectars lay in the there after.

`A few butterflies follow him out the green house, all shown as sillouttes`

`The hospital they arrive into is blue and white, and run towards the room Lesbia is in. Lesbia lays there IV drip, her lips are purple and face pale. Blonde locks matted to the pillow.` 

Sicili: Lessa!

Vio: `reaches out to touch her cousin's hand` I thought we would be safe in Galei. `tears up` They won't come looking for us.

Mr Ritter: I think whoever slipped the poison were after me.

`pans to show Mr. & Mrs. Ritter`

Vio: `looks at him annoyed` and what makes you so important?!

Mrs: She drank from a bottle of wine gifted to my husband. He's a _ for the prime minister.

Vio: Oh of course, and my cousin is just his mistress so of course no one wants her dead... `narrows her eye` except maybe you.

Mr: The three of us were having dinner. She works for us, both.

Vio: I certainly hope you pay her twice her fee.

Mr: Lessa is well compensated, I assure you.

~~Mrs: We are long time friends of her madame.~~

~~Sicili: Does Juliette know?~~

~~Mr: We will call her as soon as we get home.~~

~~Vio: Why was she the first one who drank?~~

~~Mrs: She was our guest, of course she'll have the first sip.~~

~~Vio: Or you used her as a ivory spoon.~~

~~Mr: Honestly, we didn't know.~~

~~Vio: `grabs Mr by the collar` I suppose, you don't know who gave you that bottle either.~~

~~Mrs: I am going to hire a investigator after we are sure Lessa's condition is stable.~~

~~Mr: They might try again they are after me.~~

~~Vio: Oh because you are so important. Mr. politican.~~

~~Mr: Well, I am.~~

~~Vio: How about I help whoever wants you dead out a little. Then I'll be sure Lessa won't get hurt in the crossfire. `about to punch him`~~

~~Sicili: Stop! I know you're scared, but hurting them won't help Lessa nor give us assurance whoever poisoned that bottle isn't after us.~~

`a nurse walks in`

Sicili: What did the doctor say?

Nurse: Your cousin is in stable condition now. The toxin we end up find in her blood is peculiar.

Vio: `narrows her eyes` What do you mean peculiar?

Nurse: It seems to be from a x butterfly that is not found in this country. They mostly live in the Atonian peninsula.

Vio: that’s impossible! I’ve seen this used in my childhood. Once the fluid leaves the butterfly's body it solidifies and no longer becomes fatal after 3 days. And it's at least a week's travel between this city and even the northern border of Atonia.

Mrs: So whoever made the poison must have made it here, and the wine couldn't have been a week old. I'll ask our doorman to check visitors who may have dropped of this within the past week.

Nurse: Anyway, she should come to in a few hours, but we'll like to keep her over night for observation.

Sicili: We understand, thank you.

`while they are walking out the hospital`

Vio: They are wrong, the poison was meant for Lessa.

Sicili: Just because...

Vio: It came from our homeland! Who wants us dead? People who might from home who don't want us to comeback and the rightful heirs of Renova.

Sicili: It could just be a coincidence. We aren't the only Atonians in the city. And the botanical garden house butterflies from all over the world.

`45 aerial view of the bridges and river, one of the bridges is wide, with levels and green houses and plants instead of vehicles, the sun is starting to set in the background.`

`Vio turns around in the garden. Show all the people and plants overwhelming her.` 

Erik: `leaning down` Nice place for a date `Runs his hands down the stem of a rose. Of course there is no blood`

Vio: As if that will ever happen for me.

`Zaki looks up at them from his painting briefly, puts on his sun glasses with other people a walking around them.` (other people around too)

Erik: `gets closer to her and says softly` we're here now... `brings his face up to hers` and the sun is about to set.

Vio: `closes her eyes` we're on a mission`Vio holds her nose, trying to focus on her surroundings`

Erik: Is there really someone after your sister and cousin?

Vio: I'm going to make sure there isn't. I didn't come all this way just to lose them again!

`They walk inti the butterfly exhibit`

Erik: What an odd time to be wearing shades. `motions to Zaki`

Vio: Maybe he's blind... then I guess he won't be painting.

Erik: Talk to him

Vio: About what?

Erik: `shrugs` Start with complementing his painting. Artist open up when you love their work... like you see into a piece of their soul... or some bull like that.

Vio: What if it's ugly. I wouldn't be able to tell a convincing lie.

Erik: `leans into her ears` you lie to yourself all the time

`Vio turns to the painting, grasp in a heavy breathe`

Vio: That's *anything but ugly*

`It is a watercolor with flowers and bufferlies including X butterfly. While in in awed by the painting, Erik scares Vio to lurch forward making her knock into Zaki, and red ink splatters all over it.`

`Zaki turns around, just as Vio falls on top of him.`
`The sun has started to set, and falls just a little below the horizon.`

- [ ]  A few panels of wordless expressions

Vio: So... sorry, I ruined your painting

Zaki: It was already ruined. `picks up the watercolor paper and starts tearing it apart` the shadows have changed form when I first started his afternoon.

Vio: No one could tell. I liked it, especially those black and white butterflies. 

Zaki: The Kuvarinni  butterflies are quiet the beauty. Did you know after mating the male gives all his body's toxins to his mate? The next time a predator approaches him, he's likely going to die.

Vio: That's an all in one bet he's making.

Zaki: `smilies` He just knows she's the one when he sees her. "Love is

Both: sacrifice."

Vio: said the legendary poet. Can't he produce more toxin?

Zaki: The toxins in their bodies are from the seeds they ate as caterpillars. The amount of toxin he had before morphing is all he will ever have.

Vio: So those extracting toxins from them, they will..

Zaki: `nods` hurt their chances of surviving in nature. Best you can do is provide domestic sanctuary for them.

Vio: Where I'm from people used Kuvarrina poison all the time, I didn't know it would...

Zaki: They probably took it from the pregnant butterflies. Since a female can mate and receive toxin multiple times in her life span. It would a more sustainable as a business.

`Hold his finger up to a butterfly to a  land on`

Zaki: But they must be careful, a pregnant butterfly is aggressive, one prick from her is lethal.

Vio: *He seems to know a lot, I should ask.* Is it less potent if mixed into ingestible fluid.

Zaki: *looks up suspiciously*, meaning?

Vio: For examples mixed in wine, my cousin end up drinking wine with a taste of it... I don't know how it could have go then there..

Zaki: Was this at a party? did anyone else...

Vio: No, just her

Zaki: `Zaki crush brush in his hands` sorry 

Vio: The nurse thinks she'll recover, I was just curious so I come here.

Zaki: `nods, started packing to leave.` Give her some berry vinegar. It should blush any remaining toxin out of her body.

`Vio catches him stealing a butterfly from the garden.`

`Zaki walks through the east Ixan, with Vio's silloutte following`

Erik: What a handsome guy.

Vio: He knows too much about X butterfly.

Erik: He's an artist, I'm sure he just appreciates the vibrant colors butterflies have.

Vio: It's more than that. He suddenly starts asking more questions the moment, I mentioned Ritter. I think he knows him.

- [ ]  Most of this scene will be silent, we want to focus on showing the world of east Ixan and a day in the life of Zaki

`Zaki goes get dinner. During it someone sit down in his table, and he hands them a package.`

Guy: `takes out a iridescent vial` Top quality as always.

Zaki: Don't buy from anyone but me.

Guy: I won't dare. I won't want someone to have a stroke when I mean to put them to sleep. You heard of the products out in the market these days? Extracting toxins from the cacoons, those farms?

Zaki: I treat my providers with utmost care.

Guy: I know, that's what makes you the best in town.

`The waiter delivers Vio coffee, she drinks it without realizing there's grinds under it`

Zaki: I would like one of your firework contacts.

guy: Why? It's a rather messy affair. Not normally your style.

Zaki: I need their coverage. That's something my needles don't get.

Guy: Well, I do know a guy in the courier district. He's discrete too...

`Zaki walks through the courier district, it's on the riverside near the docks.`

Narration: A little more than a year ago, Galei's postal service lost funding. In its collapsed private couriers sprung up.

`body guards outside many small shops`

Narration: Competition is fierce, and soon turned brutal. Each business tried to sabotage each other, to ruin their competitors reputation. Whoever knew mail deliver can be such a dangerous endeavor.

`Zaki enters a small stall. It's yellow and blue. Vio stops outside observing him. She couldn't make out waht he's saying. So the dialog comes out as blurry words. She does make out bits of the address, because the clerk repeats it back to Zaki. And also something about the impact radius.`

`The clerk ask Zaki something that makes him look around`

`Vio turns to a flyer when he turns in he direction. She picks it up`

Bodyguard: `comes up to Vio`. You're tiny, but it looks like you can pack some blows. `touches her arm`

Vio: `jumps away` Don't touch me, I'm not looking for a job.

Bodyguard: Our chief is available now if you want to come in for an interview. `leans in` we pay in cash.

Vio: Now is not `reach for a knife`

Bodyguard: `grabs her wrist` quick too, we could rally use someone like you.

Zaki: `pushes the body guard back` The lady said she's not interested.

`Vio looks up Zaki. They both have a split panel.` 

`Zaki at the top corner looks down with a smirk.`

Vio: `looking up, wide eyed` Holy hell.

`Vio & Zaki walking out into the docks`

Vio: *He was the one who almost killed Lessa, I just feel it.*

`Finally stopping near a ship`

Zaki: If you wanted to get to know me better, I could give you my number.

Vio: I don't make phone calls. You weren't intending to send someone fireworks were you?

Zaki: There can be...fireworks.

Vio: `steps forward` Who hired you? Are they from Atonia?

Zaki: Night Treader's Contract, clause 1, never reveal your clients.

Vio: `kicks forward` I know the rules.

- [ ]  Vio has the upper hand

Zaki: `ducks but trips` I see, you are one too.

Vio: why did you poison Lessa? `strikes again`

Zaki: `blocks` Clause 44, one question at a time. Who's Lessa? Is she your cousin?

Vio: `attacks again`

Zaki: `dodges behind a cart` I've been wondering, it was my first time using x butterfly. How did the poison effect her?

Vio: I ask the questions. So, my cousin was just your little experiment?

Zaki: Hey! I didn't know she wants going to be there!

`She slices, but only hits a few strands of his hair`

Vio: You're a messy night treader. With collaterals.

Zaki: I'm just an apothecary.

Vio: One who sends bombs, when he can't depend on his craft alone to get the job done.

`Zaki pushes forward`

Zaki: When you need to get a job done, who cares how it's done.

Vio: Have you no honor?!

`Vio pins him down at the right opporunity`

Zaki: Honor is a privilege. What if I told you whoever is getting my present deserves it.

Vio: It is not your right to decide who lives and dies!

Zaki: Then who's right is it? The people who hire you?

`Just when it looks like Vio has bagged another win, Zaki tricks her and flips them over`

Zaki: This nation is descending into corruption. We can't guarantee there will be justice, less we serve it ourselves. 

`Zaki injects Vio with a small dose of sleep draught`

`Vio wakes up in the morning at the docks. She picks up the locks of Zaki's hair and walks away from the rising sun.`

`Rein's sword slices through the air as Vio leans back on a duck. One her hand touches the ground she thrust her body forward to kick him in the chest. He stumbles back a bit. But catches her balance and shoves her legs to the ground`

Rein: Let's rest.

Vio: No, I need to learn to be faster.

Rein: You lost a fight. That's part of the job, at least you made it out alive.

Vio: I could have easily not. Then what?! Who will take care of Sicili?!

Rein: If you go into a fight with that mindset, no wonder you lost.

Vio: I had him! `punches the ground`

Rein: Then what?

Vio: I wasn't quick enough to see his tricks

Rein: What tricks?

Vio: He was talking, and I should have been paying more attention to his actions than words.

Rein: `whispers` what did he say that had you so distracted.

Vio: He... *asked me a question I had been wondering myself.* Do you ever wonder about what we do?

Rein: If we didn't, someone else would. After all how else will you support your sister? We do what we must, some of us don't have the privilege to determine how we earn our keep.

Vio: I suppose, I don't neither. Not when, the government doesn't even know I exist.

Rein: But the news does. You need to be less visible, otherwise it will put us all at risk. `steps behind her and guides her arm to hold her blade` Close your eyes. Now image you are someone looking from above at me and you. What do you see?

`perspective in the frontal of Vio`

Vio: You, guiding my blade. My hand bringing it to my neck.

Rein: That is how you must look at all fights, yes your body is a player. But you, yourself must now allow yourself to be in it.

Vio: ... what?

Rein: You must be the invisible eye ball. See but not be seen. Touch but not push. Observe without changing the environment.

Vio: `opens her eyes` don't use that crap on me. The Order are just bunch of power hungry zealots.

Rein: They may be. But you can't doubt the wisdom of the Lady Prophet's words. You feel too much. To feel, you would have already altered your perception of the scene. `takes Vio's hand again` Just observe. Separate your mind from your soul, and your soul from your body.

`pans out to see them, though fisheye`

Rein: `brings a knife to her back`

Vio: `grabs the wrist holding the knife`

Rein: `drops the blade` good

Rein: By the way, I've found a matching record of those locks.

`opens the file` Zaki Attar, said to have went missing X years ago. Ever since they found his parents were died in an explosion in the a chemistry lab.

Vio: `grabs the file from Rein` What was a anthrololgy profession and a poetics scholar doing in the chemistry building?

Rein: That's what the investigation wondered about too. At the end they decided since they must have been refugee spies. Embedded to steal Galeian secrets. `nurses a paper cut` When social services went to collect their son, Zaki, he had disappeared.

Vio: Marshall Ritter was the assistant working in the lab that night.

Rein: Yes, but when they questioned him. There was no motive.

Vio: What if someone paid him off?

Rein: `nods`

~~Rein: Yes, but he was out of town that weekend with in his family's vineyard.~~

~~Vio: You don't have to be present to execute your enemies. We are the living proof of that.~~

`walks with to hospital`

Erik: So are you going to warn them?

Vio: Why is that even a question. Of course!

Erik: Maybe Ritter did kill his parents.

Vio: Doesn't matter. If we go around killing people just because they have killed someone you love, there will be no one left in the world.

Erik: You make it sound like everyone is a murderer.

Vio: Anyone can be a killer under the right conditions.

Erik: like you were. ~~Even if the bomb didn't kill the Ritters, the fact that he had sent it there with intent to kill already makes him a murderer.~~ If given the chance, would you get back at the family that orchestrated the attack on your house?

Vio: I would... so I can understand him

`In the Ixan hospital around noon`

Vio: I'm here assist my cousin in her discharge.

Nurse: `not bothering to look up`. Name?

Vio: Lesbia Algiheiri

Nurse: She already left

Vio: What?~

Nurse: A lady came fifteen minutes ago to pick her up.

Vio: What did she look like? `bangs her first on the counter and the whole table shakes.`

`We see Lessa walking with Juliette. Lessa is wearing a simple shirt and high waisted trousers. Her hands around Juliette's arm, who was looking top knotch as always.`

Juliette: I thought Lessa, would want to change out of her work clothes. So I brought her something comfortable to walk out of here in.

Vio: How considerate of you, *madam*. `narrow eyes`

Lessa: `trying to ease the tension` Did you eat yet, couz? Why don't you get lunch with us?

Juliette: My treat

`At a beer hall, they take seat in an enclove with cushions as opposed to he lines of wooden tables where workers were getting lunches and a drink.`

`Juliette flirts with a waitress who brought the beer`

Vio: I know what happened. Someone is out to get Marshal Ritter.

Lessa: What? Why?

Vio: He might have been bribed to murder two academics, and now their offspring has a bomb sent to their house.

Lessa: What?! We have to warn them.

Vio: No, he deserves what is coming for him

Lessa: I know you don't believe that. You are only doing this because you secretly blame them for me getting hospitalized.

Vio: I don't place blame. It's not The Way.

Lessa: Oh, yea? Then why are we still in this city? Why don't we return home?

Vio: Because the whole we knew is has been burnt to the ground. Look, you just need to stay away from them for a while.

Lessa: I'm the older one. Yoy don't tell me what to do. They are one of our highest paying customers.

Juliette: Don't worry, Lessa will indeed be staying away from the Ritters. No amount of money is worth my girls getting hurt. So I am putting her on hazard pay. She won't be seeing any clients for a month.

Vio: `narrows eyes` oh, so this happens often.

Juliette: Not often, but I have moneys saved up for when it does. `leans in` see? working with me has way better benefits. Not all night threaders suffer your risk.

Vio: I'm not much of a talker.

Juliette: Some clients prefer those who don't talk.

Vio: I'd prefer to walk alone at night.

Juliette: Well if you ever change your mind... `winks and leaves the table to talk to someone`

Mrs Ritter: `to her husband` Better call in insurance company. `to Vio` Thank you. `gets into car and drives into sunset. Multiple cars in this block are also being driven away.`

`Vio walks back to their house and in the study with the full length windows shining through.`

`Zaki is standing there looking out the window and watch the Ritter's drive away`

Vio: The bomb that you have delivered will go off in 10 minutes.

`Zaki turns around to face Vio, the sunset from the large study paints her face. While he is in a shadows. He steps out to join her in the dusk light.`

Vio: But they are not here. In fact this whole block has been evacuated.

Zaki: You don't know what he's done.

Vio: Stage the murder of you parents?

Zaki: `looks at her quizically` How

Vio: Zaki Attar, missing for nine years. Presumed dead.

Zaki: Dead? disappeared? Does it matter? I'm just another Hastuit boy lost into the smog of this crumbling city.

Vio: If you suspected him, why not go to the police?

Zaki: `laughs` ha! You think it's just Ritter? No, several scholars had planned the accident.

Vio: `mouth opens`

Zaki: When my parents received tenure. They unwilling to accept dirty refugees got tenure after having joined the university a few years ago. They felt entitled to it!

Vio: You are saying a group of academics staged a murder?

Zaki: And with government resources dwindling, academics were the first to be cut. Anyone given the right circumstances can commit murder. The chemistry department head offered a lab technician the opportunity to work under him if he would just to them one favor.

Vio: `shocked he shares her belief`

Zaki: You've seen how rough it is in Parcel Port. No business is too boring for blood.

Vio: Who were the people that bribed them? If you kill the Ritters you may never find out.

Zaki: You think I don't know? I am aware of each and everyone involved.

Vio: And what happens after they are all dead? You'll have a bounty on your head. Is this what your parents would have wanted?

Zaki: `throws a letter opener at Vio` Don't concern yourself with what my parents want.

Vio: `blocks it with a book`

- [ ]  They fight. Show Vio being smarter about being in the invisible eyeball.
- [ ]  From her foresight she saw what's coming, and Zaki gets knocked unconscious.

Rein: `through her ear piece` Come out now!

`Vio runs out`

Rein: Did you find out the answers you were looking for?

Vio: No.

Rein: `places a hand of her shoulders` Sometimes there are no acceptable answers. Let's go before the police arrives.

Vio: Or I'm just not looking hard enough. `runs back into the house`

`Zaki wakes up and find the entire place in flames. He pulls the collar of his coat over his face and tries to make it down the stairs, but collapse.`

`He sees Vio's silloutte running towards him`

Vio: Zaki! Zaki!

Zaki `wakes up`

Vio: Is that what you still go by? What do people call you now?

Zaki: For a while, I was alone. No one called me anything.

Vio: Me too

Zaki: You...why

- [ ]  Vio saids something related to the theme

`the two make it out of the house after avoiding falling chandelier. Zaki trying to shield Vio, ends up getting impaled in the ribs a bit.`

- [ ]  Use heavily visual story telling in foreshadowing their dynamic

She looks up the spiral and sighs, they have a long way to go. When they finally arrived at the very top, there was no other units on the floor. He lived in the attic of the complex, the entire place smells of turpentine. Canvases with partially finished paintings laying out to dry along the floors. A large semicular window from the opposite wall lit the place with a dim blue night. That was when she notices the butterflies; along all the walls are are glasses cases of taxodermied butterflies of all species and breeds. Their wings splays out like watchful eyes on the guest as  they limp their way to the bed.

`Shows Vio & Zaki at the top of a spiral staircase`

`Enter Zaki's flat. Show the moon shining through the large windows`

`Pan around Zaki's butterfly collection and painting supplies`

`Zaki's trench coat drops to the ground, whist a glass cage of butterflies. One butterfly drinks nectar from a flower that blooms at night time.`
