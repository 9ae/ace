Pilot ideas:
- Ace and Helga is sent to protect Gretchen's opponents. This is the group of people who killed Zaki's parents. They suspect that Gretchen's family might be involved in the killing of the new radical party members, and pay Gretchen a visit. Helga and Gretchen hit it off. ... Ace realizes that this new radical party she is sworn to protect are actually really bad people, Zaki has planted a bomb in their estate. it blows up part of it, the wing Ace and Zaki are at is just on fire. Ace helps Zaki out of the wreckage.
- Ace gets hired by a wife who wants to see if her husband is still cheating on her (she is still primarily a spy). Zaki is hired as a body guard for her husband. Maybe we won't get introduced to Gretchen and Helga yet.
- After the previous PM dies, there's an election for the new PM. Edgar's people does not want there to be any challenge to their power, so they plant something incriminating to frame Gretchen's mom. Ace and Helga were assigned to protect Gretchen's family.

Ace and Zaki are on opposing sides of the case, at the end of the mission that get bloached she saves him, and they go back to his place.

It seems each chapter has a moral dilenma, what is it of the pilot?

In this room, there is an oolong table. Around it sits men in dark suits, some so dark they steal some light from this already dimly light room. At the end of the table furthest from the door is a man who's suit is so light absorbant that the men closer to him have to strain their pupils to see, when they look over to the other end of the table. At the other end is a figure, clothed in reflective black. 

She places one boot on the table, opens her arms like the wings of a plane. Both arms are given extentions by the aid of a dagger on each side. And like a plane in air she glides across the table, tilting, yawing to make sure her daggers come to meet the necks of each men. For it will be rude to greeting any one. When she gets to the end of the table, she smiles. She does not cut his throat, no for the man who's presence steals light, she's got something special. She returns one of her daggers to its hostler, and brings her free hand to meet her other. With both hands on the handle, she bares her teeth in a wide grin. "Here's to your last days of fucking!" she declares and she brings the dagger down onto him.

The girl in the reflective black steps out into the night. Unraveling the cobblestone paved maze, she make her way back home. And she makes it up the final set of steps leading to her flat, she can smell the aroma of tomatoes and spices.

"Vio! You're home!" her younger sister greets her.

"Dinner smells fabulous, Sicili. Thank you." Vio saids she she close the door. As she makes her way to take a closer look at tonight's meal, Sicili stops her.

"Nah-uh, we are not having blood in our pasta sauce tonight. Go wash up, it should all be ready when you get out," Sicili commanded.



Vio and Sicli sit arounda coffee table in their small flat, as they eat and watch the evening news.

"The investigation about the mysterious sum of money that disappeared in Secretary of State, Marlies Ritter's personal account is continues," declared the reporter. "Where did the money go?" The news reels back to footage with a woman with a blonde bob, making her way through the paparazzi. "She refuses to comment, stating her personal finances are her business. But can you have personal business, when you are the most popular political figure of our country?"

"They really can't think of putting her on trail can they? She's the reason Edgar von Essen got elected last term." asked Sicili.

"Galei is not like Atonia, here law is law. It doesn't matter if you put our prime minister in power." reflected Vio.

"Do you miss home?" purposed Sicili.

"How can I miss home, when I've got the best Atonian chef right here?!" Vio curls the spaghetti around her fork to take an enthusiastic bite.

Vio enters a clothing store, she chooses a blouse and brings it to the 3rd changing room. Pressing both hands into the mirrow and stares intently at herself, in a few seconds she feels the mirror starts to slide. She steps back and the mirror continues to slide revealing an elevator.
