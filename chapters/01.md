# A Night Treader's Contract

- What's Vio's internal conflict?
- How does Zaki challenge it?
- What's Vio's weakness, how does she overcome it by the end of the chapter to win against Zaki?

`slam! door falls down`

`Vio standing at the entrance, wearing a butterfly shaped Venetican mask.`

`Everyone's head turns to her. Vio slashes her way down the table.`

Head: `wide eyed` is what they say about you true?

Vio: You're about to find out.

Head: Please, spare my

Vio: Now my clients won't be getting what they paid for if they did.

Head: `whimpers` No! not my!

Vio: Here's to your last day of fucking! `brings her blade down`

`show him with neck slicked and crouch bleeding`

`from the cupboard, a sob`

Boy: Please, I have a little sister. I'm the only one who can support her.

Vio: `brings her blade to his neck leaves the room with her cloak blown by the vents`

`The streets of Ixan are light by gaslight. Only other person out is a boy in shorts walking home with a violin case.`

Erik: You are risking exposure by letting him go.

Vio: But for him, it's just a job. And no one pays as well as one of the families. I can't orphan his sister.

Erik: Does he even have a sister?

Vio: `pauses` maybe not. But he doesn't seem like someone who deserves to die.

Erik: How would you know that? You are now the judge of who has the right to live?

Vio: I ...

Erik: Have surrendered that decision to those who paid you to kill.

Vio: We are working towards a nobel cause! We are try to stop The Order from taking over Galei!

Erik: Galei, the promise land of equality and justice. And yet relies on mercenaries to maintain order.

Vio: It's more complicated than that, ever since Atonian city states fell. Galei's industry has been struggling. They are just trying to do to stay afloat.

Erik: Politics here are complicated indeed. I don't understand this country. In the mountains, the rules were simple. Survive, protect your tribe. If another tribe kills your loved one, it is your responsibility to repay the deed. What does justice event mean?

Vio: I know I am not carrying out justice for anyone. I'm just trying to support my little sister too. `looks down at her bloody hands` `smiles` I miss the mountains `reaches to hold Erik's hand` With your tribe, the only place I could be myself, the only place I belonged, is no more.

Erik: `looks up at the sky` I wonder what the order did with my kin.

Vio: That's why we must bring them down, for what they did to us. And will do to many others.`their squeeze eachother's hands`

`they had arrived at Vio's flat`

Vio: Thanks for walking me home.

Erik: Have I really walked? `lifts her chin up`

` and we see her hallways is empty, Vio turns the key into her flat`

>  Bits of this scene is in storyboarder already

`Sicili's back is turned, we see her curls. It's a small flat, with everything in one room, parts sectioned off with curtains. There is one window in the entire apartment. By the window is a pot of basil in a cup-noodle.`

Sicili: `turns around` Vio! `looks down at her sister's clothes in dismay` Throw that in with the rest of your clothes to soak.

Vio: `holds up a penny romance serial` I picked up this for you. `Vio goes to change.`

Sicili: Oh! Did Prince Alec find out Swallow-tail is not his sister yet?!

`We see Vio's bare back with the tattoo`

Vio: Isn't his torment the reason you read this series? Why release the tension so soon?

`Sicili eats her breakfast, face buried in the book. The radio is playing.`

Radio: This morning mobsters were found dead in east bank inn. Some of them brutalized. The whole room painted in blood.

`Vio comes back out in white khaki. Sicili raises an eyebrow.`

Radio:  We wonder is the city's castrating killer at it again.

Vio: `scratches her head innocently` 

Sicili: You ought to be more discrete. We can't draw too much attention to ourselves. Remember we are here illegally.

Vio: Does it matter how they die?

Sicili: It does if it's usually violent. Homicides are rare in Galei, even rarer if it's this bloodly. Why not try poison?

Vio: Poisons are for ladies...

`A man drops dead in a lush room. Behind him is a silloutte of Zaki, holding a needle. The only thing that sticks out is the siringe and Zaki's transitional glasses.` 

Zaki: Vemon of a Y butterfly. It's a quick, but not necessarily painless end. 

`The man continues to choke, as Zaki walks around the green house.`

Zaki: You'll been reunited with your friends soon. `lowering down to touch the dead man's face` You can return tot he Earth together.

`Zaki stands up, and clips a few flowers from the green house. He reaches his finger towards a flower, bringing back nectar.`

Zaki: I wonder, `licks his moist fingers, that are thin and long.` What sweet nectars lay in the there after.

`A few butterflies follow him out the green house, all shown as sillouttes`

- [ ] Zaki kills Lessa' client. is there to get info from her. Lessa thinks he is the client, she undresses we see ther familglia tattoo. But she discovers he was trying to spike her bev to get her to talk. They fight.

- [ ] Zaki escacpes, flashback to the Zaki watching his parents get killed by someone with the same tattoo

---

- [ ] Vio at the org. We see her be the only one who is Helga's friend. Make it clear the org is to expose the Order for corruption



- [ ] Lessa (also works for the org) reports what happend last night. And after she finds the corpse of her client. Upon inspection they discover the toxin used is from a rare buttefly.

Sicili: What did the doctor say?

Nurse: Your cousin is in stable condition now. The toxin we end up find in her blood is peculiar.

Vio: `narrows her eyes` What do you mean peculiar?

Nurse: It seems to be from a x butterfly that is not found in this country. They mostly live in the Atonian peninsula.

Vio: thatâ€™s impossible! Once the fluid leaves the butterfly's body it solidifies and no longer becomes effective after 3 days. And it's at least a week's travel between this city and even the northern border of Atonia.

Mrs: So whoever made the poison must have made it here, and the wine couldn't have been a week old. I'll ask our doorman to check visitors who may have dropped of this within the past week.

Nurse: Anyway, she should come to in a few hours, but we'll like to keep her over night for observation.

Sicili: We understand, thank you.

`while they are walking out the hospital`

Vio: They are wrong, the poison was meant for Lessa.

Sicili: Just because...

Vio: It came from our homeland! Who wants us dead? People who don't want us to return to Renova.

Sicili: It could just be a coincidence. We aren't the only Atonians in the city. And the botanical garden house butterflies from all over the world.

---

`45 aerial view of the bridges and river, one of the bridges is wide, with levels and green houses and plants instead of vehicles, the sun is starting to set in the background.`

`Vio turns around in the garden. Show all the people and plants overwhelming her.` 

Erik: `leaning down` Nice place for a date `Runs his hands down the stem of a rose. Of course there is no blood`

Vio: As if I'll ever have the chance

`Zaki looks up at them from his painting briefly, puts on his sun glasses with other people a walking around them.` (other people around too)

Erik: `gets closer to her and says softly` we're here now... `brings his face up to hers` and the sun is about to set.

Vio: `closes her eyes` we're on a mission`Vio holds her nose, trying to focus on her surroundings`

Erik: Is there really someone after your family?

Vio: I'm going to make sure there isn't. I won't lose them again!

`They walk into the butterfly exhibit`

Erik: What an odd time to be wearing shades. `motions to Zaki`

Vio: Maybe he's blind... then I guess he won't be painting.

Erik: Talk to him

Vio: About what?

Erik: `shrugs` Start with complementing his painting. Artist open up if you love their work... they think you see into a piece of their soul... or some bull like that.

Vio: What if it's ugly. I don't tell convincing lies.

Erik: `leans into her ears` you lie to yourself all the time

`Vio turns to the painting, grasp in a heavy breathe`

Vio: That's *anything but ugly*

`It is a watercolor with flowers and bufferlies including X butterfly. While in in awed by the painting, Erik scares Vio to lurch forward making her knock into Zaki, and red ink splatters all over it.`

`Zaki turns around, just as Vio falls on top of him.`
`The sun has started to set, and falls just a little below the horizon.`

- [ ]  A few panels of wordless expressions

Vio: So... sorry, I ruined your painting

Zaki: It was already ruined. `picks up the watercolor paper and starts tearing it apart` the shadows have changed form when I first started his afternoon.

Vio: No one could tell. I liked it, especially those green and purple butterflies. 

Zaki: The Kuvarinni  butterflies are quiet the beauty. Did you know after mating the male gives all his body's toxins to his mate? Next time a predator approaches him, he's food.

Vio: That's some bet he's making on her

Zaki: `smilies` He just knows she's the one when he sees her. "Love is

Both: sacrifice."

Vio: said the Hastuit poet, Pru. But can't he produce more toxin?

Zaki: The toxins in their bodies are from the seeds they ate as caterpillars. The amount of toxin he had before morphing is all he will ever have.

Vio: Then extracting toxins from them, are we....?

Zaki: `nods` hurt their chances of survivial.

Vio: Where I'm from people used Kuvarrina poison all the time, I didn't know it would...

Zaki: You should take toxins from the pregnant butterflies. Since a female can mate and receive toxins multiple times in her life. It is a more sustainable to get them from her.

`Hold his finger up to a butterfly to a  land on`

Zaki: But they must be careful, a pregnant butterfly is aggressive, one prick from her is lethal.

Vio: *He seems to know a lot, I should ask.* 

- [ ] reveals something about Lessa

Zaki: `Zaki crush brush in his hands` sorry 



Zaki: `nods, started packing to leave.` 

`Vio catches him stealing a butterfly from the garden.`

`Zaki walks through the east Ixan, with Vio's silloutte following`

Erik: What a charmer.

Vio: He knows too much about X butterfly.

Erik: He's an artist, I'm sure he just appreciates their vibrant colors.

Vio: It's more than that. He suddenly starts asking more questions the moment, I mentioned Ritter. I think he knows him.

- [ ]  Most of this scene will be silent, we want to focus on showing the world of east Ixan and a day in the life of Zaki

`Zaki goes get dinner. During it someone sit down in his table, it was the boy Vio had let go.`

Boy: `takes out a iridescent vial` Top quality as always. You heard of the products out in the market these days? Extracting toxins from the cacoons, those farms?

Zaki: I treat my providers with utmost care.

Guy: I know, that's what makes you the best in town.

`The waiter delivers Vio coffee, she drinks it without realizing there's grinds under it`

- [ ] zaki meets someone at the resturant. turns out to be the boy Vio let go, he sends Zaki to the parcel district

Zaki: I would like one of your firework contacts.

guy: Why? It's a rather messy affair. Not normally your style.

Zaki: I need their coverage. That's something my needles don't get.

Guy: Well, I do know a guy in the courier district.

`Zaki walks through the courier district, it's on the riverside near the docks.`

Narration: A little more than a year ago, Galei's postal service lost funding. In its collapsed private couriers sprung up. `city post office dark and with graffiti and trash`

`body guards outside many small shops`

Narration: Competition is fierce, and soon turned brutal. Each business tried to sabotage each other, to ruin their competitors reputation. Whoever knew mail deliver can be such a dangerous endeavor.

`Zaki enters a small stall. It's yellow and blue. Vio stops outside observing him. She couldn't make out waht he's saying. So the dialog comes out as blurry words. She does make out bits of the address, because the clerk repeats it back to Zaki. And also something about the impact radius.`

`The clerk ask Zaki something that makes him look around`

`Vio turns to a flyer when he turns in he direction. She picks it up`

Bodyguard: `comes up to Vio`. You're tiny, but it looks like you can pack some blows. `touches her arm`

Vio: `jumps away` Don't touch me, I'm not looking for a job.

Bodyguard: We pay in cahs. Our chief is available now if you want to come in for an interview. `leans in`

Vio: Now is not `reach for a knife`

Bodyguard: quick too, we could rally use someone like you.

Zaki: `pushes the body guard back` The lady said she's not interested.

`Vio looks up Zaki. They both have a split panel.` 

`Zaki at the top corner looks down with a smirk.`

Vio: `looking up, wide eyed` Damn.

`Vio & Zaki walking out into the docks`

- [ ] zaki & vio square off. Vio isn't aware he ordered a bomb yet, but wants to get back at him for hurting Lessa. Zaki realize Vio also has the same tattoo

Vio: *He was the one who almost killed Lessa, I just feel it.*

`Finally stopping near a ship`

Zaki: If you wanted to get to know me better, I could give you my number.

Vio: I don't make phone calls. You weren't intending to send someone fireworks were you?

Zaki: There can be...fireworks.

Vio: `steps forward` Who hired you?

Zaki: Night Treader's Contract, clause 1, never reveal your clients.

Vio: `kicks forward` I know the rules.

- [ ]  Vio has the upper hand

Zaki: `ducks but trips` I see, you are one too.

Vio: why were you after Lessa? `strikes again`  Are they from Atonia?

Zaki: `blocks` Clause 44, one question at a time. Who's Lessa? Your cousin?

Vio: `attacks again`

Zaki: `dodges behind a cart` I've been wondering, it was my first time using x butterfly. How did the poison effect her?

Vio: I ask the questions. So, my cousin was just your little experiment?

Zaki: Hey! I didn't know she wants going to be there!

`She slices, but only hits a few strands of his hair`

Vio: You're a messy night treader. With collaterals.

Zaki: I'm just an apothecary.

Vio: One who sends bombs.

`Zaki pushes forward`

Zaki: When you need to get a job done, who cares how it's done.

Vio: Have you no pride?! And honor for your craft?!

`Vio pins him down at the right opporunity`

Zaki: Honor is a privilege. What if I told you whoever is getting my present deserves it.

Vio: It is not your right to decide who lives and dies!

Zaki: Then who's right is it? The people who hire you?

`Just when it looks like Vio has bagged another win, Zaki tricks her and flips them over`

Zaki: This nation is descending into corruption. We can't guarantee there will be justice, lest we serve it ourselves. 

`Zaki injects Vio with a small dose of sleep draught`

`Vio wakes up in the morning at the docks. She picks up the locks of Zaki's hair and walks away from the rising sun.`

`Rein's sword slices through the air as Vio leans back on a duck. One her hand touches the ground she thrust her body forward to kick him in the chest. He stumbles back a bit. But catches her balance and shoves her legs to the ground`

Rein: Let's rest.

Vio: No, I need to learn to be faster.

Rein: You lost a fight. That's part of the job, at least you made it out alive.

Vio: I could have easily not. Then what?! Who will take care of Sicili?!

Rein: If you go into a fight with that mindset, no wonder you lost.

Vio: I had him! `punches the ground`

Rein: Then what?

Vio: I wasn't quick enough to see his tricks

Rein: What tricks?

Vio: He was talking, and I should have been paying more attention to his actions than words.

Rein: `whispers` what did he say that had you so distracted.

Vio: He... *asked me a question I had been wondering myself.* Do you ever wonder about what we do?

Rein: If we didn't, someone else would. After all how else will you support your sister? We do what we must, some of us don't have the privilege to determine how we earn our keep.

Vio: I suppose, I don't neither. 

Rein: steps behind her and guides her arm to hold her blade` Close your eyes. Now image you are someone looking from above at me and you. What do you see?

`perspective in the frontal of Vio`

Vio: You, guiding my blade. My hand bringing it to my neck.

Rein: That is how you must look at all fights, yes your body is a player. But you, yourself must now allow yourself to be in it.

Vio: ... what?

Rein: You must be the invisible eye ball. See but not be seen. Touch but not push. Observe without changing the environment, first before each move. That way you can see what your opponent sees.

Vio: `opens her eyes` don't use that crap on me. The Order are just bunch of power hungry zealots.

Rein: They may be. But you can't doubt the wisdom of the Lady Prophet's words. You feel too much. To feel, you would have already altered your perception of the fight. `takes Vio's hand again` Just observe. Separate your mind from your soul, and your soul from your body.

`pans out to see them, though fisheye`

Rein: `brings a knife to her back`

Vio: `grabs the wrist holding the knife`

Rein: `drops the blade` good

Rein: By the way, I've found a matching record of those locks.

`opens the file` Zaki Attar, said to have went missing some years ago. Ever since they found his parents were died in an explosion in the a chemistry lab.

Vio: `grabs the file from Rein` What was a anthrololgy profession and a poetics scholar doing in the chemistry building?

Rein: That's what the investigation wondered about too. At the end they decided since they must have been refugee spies. Embedded to steal Galeian secrets. `nurses a paper cut` When social services went to collect their son, Zaki, he had disappeared.

Vio: Marshall Ritter was the assistant working in the lab that night.

Rein: Yes, but when they questioned him. There was no motive.

Vio: What if someone paid him off?

Rein: `nods`

`walks with to hospital`

Erik: So are you going to warn them?

Vio: Why is that even a question. Of course!

Erik: Maybe Ritter did kill his parents.

Vio: Doesn't matter. If we go around killing people just because they have killed someone you love, there will be no one left in the world.

Erik: You make it sound like everyone is a murderer.

Vio: Anyone can be a killer under the right conditions.

Erik: like you were. If given the chance, would you get back at the family that orchestrated the attack on your house?

Vio: I would... so I can understand him

- [ ] Vio realizes Zaki had ordered a mystical butterfly bomb to juliette's boarding house

`We see Lessa walking with Juliette. Lessa is wearing a simple shirt and high waisted trousers. Her hands around Juliette's arm, who was looking top knotch as always.`

Juliette: I thought Lessa, would want to change out of her work clothes. So I brought her something comfortable to walk out of here in.

Vio: How considerate of you, *madam*. `narrow eyes`

Lessa: `trying to ease the tension` Did you eat yet, couz? Why don't you get lunch with us?

Juliette: My treat

`At a beer hall, they take seat in an enclove with cushions as opposed to he lines of wooden tables where workers were getting lunches and a drink.`

`Juliette flirts with a waitress who brought the beer`

Vio: I know what happened. Someone is out to get Marshal Ritter.

Lessa: What? Why?

Vio: He might have been bribed to murder two academics, and now their sonhas a bomb sent to their house.

Lessa: What?! We have to warn them.

Vio: No, he deserves what is coming for him

Lessa: I know you don't believe that. You are only doing this because you secretly blame them for me getting hospitalized.

Vio: I don't place blame. It's not The Way. Look, you just need to stay away from them for a while.

Lessa: I'm the older one. Yoy don't tell me what to do. They are one of our highest paying customers.

Juliette: Don't worry, Lessa will indeed be staying away from the Ritters. No amount of money is worth my girls getting hurt. So I am putting her on hazard pay. She won't be seeing any clients for a month.

Vio: `narrows eyes` oh, so this happens often.

Juliette: Not often, but I have moneys saved up for when it does. `leans in` see? working with me has way better benefits. Not all night threaders suffer your risk.

Vio: I'm not much of a talker.

Juliette: Some clients prefer those who don't talk.

Vio: I'd prefer to walk alone at night.

Juliette: Well if you ever change your mind... `winks and leaves the table to talk to someone`

---
`Juliette's house is a large Victorian mansion.`

```
What is Vio feeling going into this scene?
She is nervous because Zaki beat her once. Yet is is also angry and feels played. She goes in walls up and stakes out.
```
Vio: Is that everyone?

Juliette: `nods` Thank you.

`Vio walks back to the house and in the study with the full length windows shining through.`
'
`Zaki is standing there looking out the window and watch everyone leave in carriages.`

Vio: The bomb you have ordered will arrive in 10 minutes.

`Zaki turns around to face Vio, the sunset from the large study paints her face. While he is in a shadows. He steps out to join her in the dusk light.`

Zaki: Pity, a house of ill reputate deserves it, don't you think?

Vio: It is not your right to decide, Zaki Attar.

Zaki: `looks at her quizically` How? I guess it doesn't matter, because only one of us will make it out of this house alive tonight.

Vio: After they discovered your parents bodies. You were no where to be found. Missing for nine years. Presumed dead.

Zaki: Dead? disappeared? Does it matter? I'm just another Hastuit boy lost into the smog of this crumbling city.

Vio: The people you work for profit from each stoned removed from Ixan's foundation.

Zaki: `laughs` you think I have a choice

Vio: You always have a choice

Zaki: No, choice is a privledge dead orphans like me were never given. 

Vio: I lost my parents too.

Zaki: Did you watch them slaughtered in front of your eyes?

Vio: No...

Zaki: Then you don't know 


```
HDW escalate? 
```

Zaki: When my parents received tenure. They unwilling to accept dirty refugees got tenure after having joined the university a few years ago. They felt entitled to it!

Vio: You are saying a group of academics staged a murder?

Zaki: And with government resources dwindling, academics were the first to be cut. Anyone given the right circumstances can commit murder. The chemistry department head offered a lab technician the opportunity to work under him if he would just to them one favor.

Vio: `shocked he shares her belief`

Zaki: You've seen how rough it is in Parcel Port. No business is too boring for blood.

Vio: Who were the people that bribed them? If you kill the Ritters you may never find out.

Zaki: You think I don't know? I am aware of each and everyone involved.

Vio: And what happens after they are all dead? You'll have a bounty on your head. Is this what your parents would have wanted?

Zaki: `throws a letter opener at Vio` Don't concern yourself with what my parents want.

Vio: `blocks it with a book`

- [ ]  They fight. Show Vio being smarter about being in the invisible eyeball.
- [ ]  From her foresight she saw what's coming, and Zaki gets knocked unconscious.

Rein: `through her ear piece` Come out now!

`Vio runs out`

Rein: Did you find out the answers you were looking for?

Vio: No.

Rein: `places a hand of her shoulders` Sometimes there are no acceptable answers. Let's go before the police arrives.

Vio: Or I'm just not looking hard enough. `runs back into the house`

`Zaki wakes up and find the entire place in flames. He pulls the collar of his coat over his face and tries to make it down the stairs, but collapse.`

`He sees Vio's silloutte running towards him`

Vio: Zaki! Zaki!

Zaki `wakes up`

Vio: Is that what you still go by? What do people call you now?

Zaki: For a while, I was no one. Thus no one called me anything.

Vio: Me too

Zaki: why... you

- [ ]  Vio saids something related to the theme

`the two make it out of the house after avoiding falling chandelier. Zaki trying to shield Vio, ends up getting impaled in the ribs a bit.`

- [ ]  Use heavily visual story telling in foreshadowing their dynamic

She looks up the spiral and sighs, they have a long way to go. When they finally arrived at the very top, there was no other units on the floor. He lived in the attic of the complex, the entire place smells of turpentine. Canvases with partially finished paintings laying out to dry along the floors. A large semicular window from the opposite wall lit the place with a dim blue night. That was when she notices the butterflies; along all the walls are are glasses cases of taxodermied butterflies of all species and breeds. Their wings splays out like watchful eyes on the guest as  they limp their way to the bed.

`Shows Vio & Zaki at the top of a spiral staircase`

`Enter Zaki's flat. Show the moon shining through the large windows`

`Pan around Zaki's butterfly collection and painting supplies`

`Zaki's trench coat drops to the ground, whist a glass cage of butterflies. One butterfly drinks nectar from a flower that blooms at night time.`
