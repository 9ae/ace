The sun streams its rays through the window of a empty room. Ada can't recall when was the last time the sun had shined here, since Yihan always had his curtains down. Last night when Vio and Yule finally rejoined them at the car, it was late. So Yule offered everyone a place to say in the guest suites of the cathedral. By the time Alan and Ada returned to their flat this morning Yihan and all his belongings are gone.

She steps inside, feeling the sunlight through the glass burn on her skin. The room still smells of the body freshener he uses, cloves and cucumber. She walks towards the curtains and wraps them around her arms as she sinks down to the ground.

Ada stays in Yihan's room like this for a while, she isn't sure how long. Maybe twenty minutes, maybe a few hours. She runs through her memories for the moments they've shared together over the pass four years. In and out of faking, she drifts... if only she can bottle all these moments into her dreams. The loud buzz of a doorbell breaks her out of reverie.

At the door, she finds her brother's boyfriend. "Good morning!" he greets her cheerfully. She backs away from the door, letting Adolf steps in.

"Are you feeling ill?" Adolf ask.

"No. Do I look ill?" says Ada.

"You look...", Adolf says. '*vacant? Like you a trying to hold yourself together by loose threads.*' "You look a bit spaced out."

"Oh, we just had a long night," she answers. "Alan in this room, by the way."

Adolf takes this as a cue that she no longer wants to talk about what's troubling her, and went to the bedroom. Alan had been hitting a punching bag dangling from the ceiling when Adolf comes in. His undershirt clung to his chest glossy with sweat. It look Adolf some restraint to not tackle Alan to his bed. And it took Alan several throws to notice someone had come in. "Oh! Sorry I didn't hear you come in."

"Man, what's with you two today. Your sister seems rather distracted when she answer the door. Is Yihan in the clouds too?" ask Adolf.

Alan replies by holding onto a long silence. Taking off his gloves he hits the punching bag one last time with his bare fist.

"Oh god! Is he alright? Is that why you two are," Adolf says.

"He's alive... and I think safe," Alan explains. "He left us last night."

"What do you mean left?" Adolf ask. And Alan tells in everything. How they tried to rescue Sicili, how at the end of their mission, Yihan announces that he will be servering connection with the Harts. When he finally finished, Adolf had very little to say... "oh man. What a night. But I feel there's something missing..."

"Maybe. But he made his choice, and I so I'm going to respect that," says Alan. "Oh to happier things. Are you working the upcoming Saturday?"

"No, why? Do you have something special in mind?" Adolf whispers into Alan's neck/

Alan chuckles in a low tone he rarely uses. "Well, there's this ball. I think a governor is going to announce someone their family is adopting or something. And I would like you to be my date?"

"It's a ball, and public officials will be there?" ask Adolf.

"Yes, a very public event. If you don't mind? It will be nice for us to be seen our in public for once," says Alan.

"Then a lot of people who are my clients and their family will be there," Adolf explains. "People will talk about the company you keep."

"I don't care," says Alan, pushing a few strands of hair from Adolf's forehead. "I want the whole world to know, but firstly I want you to know. I love you."

Adolf didn't know what to say, it's the only time anyone has said those words to him outside the throws of passion. He kisses Alan, who presses back. When they finally parted lips, Adolf takes this chance to pull hair from Alan's face, "I love you too." They kiss again, this time longer. For hours they wrap themselves in the other person.

By the time they are taking again, the sun is setting. Adolf starts, "I'm still not sure, if I'll be ready to come as your date."

"Ok, I guess.. you're not ready," Alan stumbles with his words a little disappointed and uncertain.

"But I do want us to be seen in public together," Adolf reassures him. "Maybe we can start with something public, but not in a room with public figures?"

"Adolf _, would you like to go to the New Year's Philoharmonic with me?" Alan ask an offical sounding voice to tease him

"Alan Hart, Lord of Wickshire, there nowhere I'd rather be than at the orchestra with you," giggles Adolf, laying another kiss on the sweetest man in the world.

Yule had been staying with Vio since they got back from their failed mission. He didn't trust his adoptive little sister to not do something irrational in the search of her actual younger sister. This is a rare evening in which Vio didn't have to go to work tonight, so they can eat dinner at a leisurely pace. The television is tuned in to the evening news, as he tries to make conversation while she twirls her spaghetti around her fork.

"Are you trying to make yarn balls with those?" Yule ask jokingly. No reply. He gets back to eating his own food. With Sicili gone, there's no cook in the house, and their takeout containers are piled high.

The TV anchor talks about one of the governors who doesn't have children is adopting a sixteen year old into her family. The footage shows a picture of a woman and her wife, with a brunette girl waving at the crew of reporters. "What is notable is the girl before was an illegal resident, performing terrorist acts for The Order. By adopting her, she can now become a legal citizen of Galei and stay here leading a normal life. They are saying to the people of Galei, we can help you in ways The High Priest never can. Miss, how do you feel about their extension of kindness?"

"I am ever so grateful that Nadine and Sakina have decided to take me in," she says softly.

Vio suddenly looks up, because she recognized the voice. And right before her eyes, staring at her in black and white and grainly dots is her very own sister. About to become a member of another family. Maybe this is for the best, Sicili will live a happier live under the care. Their entire mission into Ryker's facility had been a waste of time, and she cost the Harts their long time friend.

The her doorbell jingles, she turns her head towards it but makes no motion to stand up. "I'll get it," Yule announces. Yule opens the door to Zaki standing there, gone is his usual trench coat, instead he wore a black turtleneck sweater and brown slacks. "Sorry, we aren't talking to traitors today," Yule is about to close the door on his face.

"Wait, it's about Sicili!" Zaki calls out holding his hand on the door. "I think she is..."

"Being adopted by a governor?" Yule says sarcastically. "Yea, we know." He opens the door wider to reveal they are watching the broadcast.

Zaki takes this opportunity to step in, completely ignoring Yule he address Vio. "I can get you a chance to talk to her. But I will also neeed your help."

Vio looks at him for a few seconds, and finally stands up leveling herself to his eye level, replies "what do you have in mind?"

---

Vio takes Zaki to the roof of her building, while Yule cleans up dinner. They look out into lights on the bridges overlooking the river. Zaki lays out the explanation, he meant to give. He told her about his parents death, and how he's been trying to get close to Edgar for years.

"Therefore I decided to take up the job in Varin," he says.

"To get into the prime minister's good graces," Vio says. "And now that you have, you've even been invited to this ball. You think it's the chance to do it."

It is starting to get cold, Vio rubs her arms with her arms. When Zaki extended his harms to bring her under the warmth of his sweater she backs away and continues to rub her arms.

Zaki nods, "and I need your help. He may still have one or two guards with him, and the _ mansion is not a very heavily monitored place. I plan to do it peacefully, drop venom into his wine. But I want him to know, it is I who did it."

"If that is how you plan to kill him. Why do you need me? I'm a much messier killer than you," Vio says. 

"If everything goes according to plan, then maybe your skills won't be necessary. And you'll just be a beautiful woman in my arms," he says with a sheepish grin.

Vio blushes, imagining what it would be like if they really were what they appear to be showing to the world. If they weren't there to kill the prime minister, if they were really a couple attending a ball together. But he wouldn't be here if it wasn't for his mission. They are not a couple, what they are killers, each with an objective of their own. She turns away while still speaking, "My skills are the only reason you are here. You definitely need me to do more than smile, because people have told me that my smile is terrifying."

"Depends on when, you do seem pretty cheerful when shoving your knife into someone's chest," tease Zaki. "But we shouldn't come to that, for the first few hours I'll monitor Edgar closely. You can use that time to talk to Sicili."

"Once it's safe to proceed, we'll let eachother know," Zaki explains.

"How do we know let eachtoher know?" Vio ask.

Zaki walks up to her with his hand in a lose fist, his knuckles glide up the side of her neck. Lightly catching the lobe of her ears in between his fingers he gives her ears a gentle hug. He smiles, Vio acknowleding the signal does the same on to him. He surpresses a groan by closing his eyes to let out a deep breathe. They both stand in this position for a while, holding onto eachother's ears. "Then for the actual ask?" Vio ask popping their bubble. 

"We've always worked better together when we play by ear," he says, he chuckles a little at his own pun. Vio does not find it funny. She steps back leaning against the railing, she rocks her body back and forth. Zaki continues, "but I have our getaway plan in place. The ball ends at midnight, people will start going home about an hour before. We want to sneak out before then, so at 10:30 a carriage will come for us. It's supplied with several days worth of living supplies, just in case we need to get away and hide out for a while."

Vio turns looking at him directly in the eye for the first time since she shut the door on him a few days ago, asks "will Sicili be able to come with us if it turns out she's coerced into this adoption?"

"Yes, of course," says Zaki.

"Okay, count me in," Vio annoucnes.

Zaki smiles. "Lastly, what color dress will you be wearing Saturday? I'll get you a flower to match."

"I don't own a dress," Vio realizes.

---

Normally clothing shopping is something Vio will enlist the help of her sister, but Sicili is not around to give encouraging advice. Her only female friend, Helga is in Ivonne. When Vio called Ada, Alan picked up and told her she wasn't feeling well. He was however delighted to hear that she too will be attending the ball. She wanders the store,  running her hands through a rack of dress barely paying attention of any of them. An sale's woman comes up to her, "Miss can I help you to day?"

Vio curses under her breathe, she hates having to interact with sales people. They make her feel rushed. If she doesn't even know what she is looking for how does she tell other people what she needs?! Not to mention, she has trouble accepting "help" from others. Not even looking up to make eye contact, she mutters "No, I'm just browsing."

"Are you sure?" She asks.

'Yes, please go away.' Vio thinks. But before she can be rude to the lady, the wind chimes at the entrance rings and a woman in a white fur coat and ornate hat walks in. The sales lady bothering her, immediately steps away to great the new, and hopefully more socially inclined customer, "Madame Rosseau! It's so nice to see you!"

Vio turns your head down and continues half heartedly looking for a dress. After a few more racks of browsing, a shadow cast upon her vision. "Never thought I'll see you here," Juliette Rosseau says to Vio.

"Madame," Vio breathes out. She doesn't know what else to say, especially since the last time she and this woman came face to face Vio was blackmailing this woman.

Juliette Rooseau smilies, trying to ease the tension, "I think this will look stunning on you." She holds up a slim dress, black with blue and violet tool weaved into the pattern of a _ butterfly's wings.

Of course Madame has an eye for finding outfits befitting of other woman. The dress indeed is beautiful, so beautiful she has a hard time imagining it on herself. Sicili, maybe. But it might be a little too revealing for her sister's modest taste. Then again what does she know of her sister.

"Lessa had one similar. Everytime she wore it..." Juliette reflects, as if lost in memory of her late lover.

"My cousin made everyone drop to her knees, everytime she entered a room, regardless of what she was wearing." Vio says flatly. "She could have been in a hazardous materials suit, and people will still bow to her beautiful. She was powerful that way."

Juliette laughs, "yea you're, right. Have you found out who was her killer yet?"

The question kicked her in the stomach. She's been so wrapped up with work and then Sicili lately. "No, I haven't."

"When you do, make them suffer," Juliette says with a wink. "So I think the castrating assassin will kill in this dress. Why don't you try it on?"

Before she could object Juliette rushed her to the dressing room. Vio looks at the mirror after she puts it on. She wonders is this how Juliette gets girls to work for her, by putting them in dresses that takes their breath away.

"When you are ready let's see it." Juliette calls taking a poof from her cigarette holder.

Vio steps through the curtains, Juliette stands up. "Not bad." Vio looks nervously at the "No Smoking" sign, Juliette follows her glaze.

"Oh, don't worry about that," Juliette explains. "The owner and I go way back. We'll what do you think?"

"I..." Vio starts.

"love it!" Juliette speaks for her. She motions for the sales lady to come, and commands her to wrap this dress up for Vio.

"Thank you Madame," Vio says bowing as they walk out of the shop. "I don't know how I can ever..."

"If you want to thank me, kill that bastard for me," Juliette demands. And with that Madame Juliette Rosseau swaggers away.

---

A triad of irises tied to Vio's left wrist, her other hand looks into Zaki's arms as they pass through the gates of _ mansion. Balls and parties were remants of her past life in Atonia, a family obligation she never thought she'll have to endure again. Zaki hand combed his normal messy shoulder length mock, into a neat bun. He wore a grey waist coat with dark shirt. She added a corset of her dress, the steel frame of it help conceal the indent of two knifes she hid inside.

They both feel out of place, the ballroom was filled with people who they spent years avoiding and hiding from. To stand under the glaring new electric chandeliers feels exposed. Vio grips on to Zaki tighter and she can feel him stiff.

Who didn't look out of place are the Harts. Alan in a cream suit and lavendar tie, holds a glass of champange in each hand talking excitedly to tall man in a heather grey jacket. Ada draws a smile with her lips, as she walks up to them. She is wearing a black dress with roses embroidered up from the hem. "Sorry, I couldn't go dress shopping with you. Looks like you did pretty alright without my help." She scans Vio a few times up and down.

"Yes, I was rather surprised myself. Who knew the girl with a knife can clean up so nice." Zaki says.

Vio turns a bit pink. She turns away and scans the room for a her sister as Ada and Zaki talk. Sicili nor the woman who adopted her seem to be in sight. Starting to be worried that she had been lead tricked into coming here, or what if Sicili wasn't going to show up and she had done all this preparation for nothing.

"You look like you can tear his arm off," Alan says loudly as he hands one drink in his hand to his sister.

"Oh," Vio finally lets go of Zaki. Wanting still to look around more, she excuses herself to the restroom. Ada offers to take her, but she declined the offer. She never understood the ritual of women going to the toliet together.

"So, you are the mystery man she's been seeing," Alan tease after Vio left.

A little caught off guard, Zaki stutters, "has she said a lot about me?"

"Just that you're bad news," Ada winks. From the corner of her eye, she notices there's a man in his mid thirties looking at their group for longer than just a passing cursory glance. Does she know him? Maybe he's one of Zaki's friends? But his attention seems more focused on her and her brother. He could be someone Alan had worked with, while she and Yihan often stuck together on assignments. Alan's skill set is different and often gets sent tasks to do on his own or with other members of the intelligence department.

When Zaki excuses himself to look for Vio, Ada sides closer to her brother and whispers. "That man over there in the dark green tailcoat, do you know him?"

"No, should I?" Alan says.

"He's been watching us for the last three ten minutes. Are you sure he's not some jealous ex lovers of yours?" Ada ask.

"He's a little scruffy for my taste," Alan says taking a sip of his beverage. "Oh! Shrimp bombs!" He drags his sister to the direction of a waiter holding a platter of fried shrimp wrapped in bacon.

---

Vio had indeed gone to the bathroom, but Sicili wasn't there either. She used the privacy of the stalls to gather her courage to return to the party. She hated events like these, she was never sure of what to do, who to talk to. Everyone seems to be having a great time, chatting, eating, drinking, but how did they know when is the appropriate time for what? How long should they talk to their acquaintances before they felt their time was dominated? It was even worse when you don't know anyone, how did you introduce yourself to new people? She wished she had decided to case this event as a waitress, at least then she knew what was expected of her, and she could perform up to the expectations of that role. But she did have a role here, to help Zaki and find her sister. '*Just smile*,' she tells herself as she takes one last look into the mirror and return back to the ball.

Stepping outside the lady's room, she encounter someone she never imagined she'll see at an event like this, her boss. Jacques was talking to a man with red hair and laughing. He wore a light gray pinstripe suit, with a dark blue tie. He notices she was starring at him in disbelief, and excuses himself from the conversation with the redheaded man. '*How do people so gracefully do that?*' Vio wonders.

When he approached her, "you look nice."

"As do you. What are you doing here? Who else is here on this mission?" she ask, skipping any pleasantries. Jacques was her boss after all, he knows her personality.

"Haha, no I'm not on a mission." Jacques says. "I'm just here to catch up with some old school makes. This ball is sponsored by my university's alumni association."

"Oh," she didn't know that he had even attended university. Then again there is so much they never knew about Jacques, when it seemed he knew everything about them. He sometimes seem to know things that they didn't.... then she suddenly remember her own interview. "I have to ask you something!"

Jacques raises his eye brows, and shrugs open the arm holding his drink, motioning her to proceed.

"A long time ago, you asked me had I never been in contact with Lady Aradia. Why did you ask that?" Vio says directly looking into his eyes.

"Your fighting style, sometimes you moved as if possessed by the spirit of another being. I've met folks touched by her magic. They move as if their own spirit had left them, and been replaced by a demon," Jacques explains. "I had always wanted someone with that type of mystic power in my team. But if you said you never met her, then maybe your powers comes from somewhere else."

"Was that the reason you hired me? For my mysterious powers?" she demands. She had always thought she held her job because of her skills and chunning as a fighter. She was proud of her work, and it felt good to have someone believe in your abilites for once.

Jacques sighs, "I hired you for your exception abilites as a fighter. It didn't hurt that you had an exotic unpredictable power, especially if we can learn to harness it one day."

Vio just stands there stunned, she wanted to draw one of the daggers from her corset this second. But instead she just digs her nails into the palm of her hand.

He continues, "We are not really in a place to discuss work, especially the work we do. Let's resume this conversation in my office another day. Have fun at the ball tonight, I heard one of the governors is going to make announcment tonight." With that he walks off returning to the ball room.

Vio stands there shaking... '*did he also know of Sicili's adoption. Of course it wasn't a secret, she had been on TV and he had met her younger sister.*' Did everyone know about the source of the fugue state besides her?! Had she only held on to her job for so long because she was a novelty, a weapon Jacques will unlock the powers to harness. Was she just his Ace card.

"There you are!" she looks up to find Zaki holding up a plate of snacks. He holds it to her in offering. "Better eat something, so we'll have energy." He walks a little closer to her and in a quieter tone says, "by the way, the governor and her newly adopted daugther arrived."

Vio nods, "thanks for letting me know." She takes a bite of a small round fried potato with cream and herbs .

"I'm going to look around," Zaki says. "Good luck with Sicili." He leaves the plate of food with Vio as he starts to take note of the rooms and security in the venue. Vio rapidly finishes bites of her food, hoping no one will try to talk to her in the meantime. She hates having to eat and make polite conversation. Something about the act of eating is just impolite by nature. Social eating is just an oxymoron. Once done, she washes her hands in the powder room, before heading back to the main ballroom.

Her sister is not hard to locate for she is the talk of the night and is surrounded by people waiting to get to know her. Vio sees a few attendees and staff members walking up and down a large set of stairs. That's an angle Sicili will definitely see her in if she directed her attention there. She walks up the stairs, purposely knocking into a waitress carrying a tray of beverages. The collision made a loud clatter, and more than half of the room turn to look at them. She will have to thank Madame Juliette for chosing this heavy patterned dark dress for her, because even though some beverages did spill on her, none of it will stain. Sicili too looks up, the Alighieri sisters caught eachother's eyes.

Sicili was surprised to see her, but her face quickly returns to neutral as she nods to her older sister. She turns back to the small crowd of people surrounding her. Vio apologizes to the waitress, before making her way back to the restroom. Sicili excuses herself, and follows her older sister.

Once they are both outside of public eye, Sicili hugs her sister and giggles. "Just like the old times. How did you know I was here? How did you even get here?"

"Zaki, long story." Vio says. "How did you end up from going to be arrested to being the daughter of a governor?"

"Well, that's also a long story. After I was arrested, they took me in for questioning... they asked me alot of questions about The Order. But I didn't know very much about them. I was just helping Yule out. Then they asked me questions about you."

Vio feels all her blood drain out of that moment. They took Sicili instead of Yule because of her. All this effort in keeping her sister safe, her very actions had endangered her. How could she not have realized sooner?! "what about me?"

"Who do you work for? What other people were you working with? Do we live together? What is Ace's real name?" Sicili explains. "But I didn't say anything, you don't talk about work anyway. And for what I did know, I couldn't risk you too. They also asks alot about Zaki. They seem to think that I'm important to him some how. I don't know what gave them that idea."

'*You don't know how much you are, you are important to so many people. Maybe that's why they took you, because you matter to so many people they want gone.*' Vio says in her mind. "Did they hurt you?"

"They asked alot of questions," Sicili "and I was in there for such a long time."

"Did they hurt you?" this time she demands.

"Nothing that won't heal, just burns when I seemed like I was hiding information about you." Sicili says.

"Where!" Vio demands. Sicili lifts the sleeves of her dress to reveal horizontal think red lines on her arms. "Anywhere else?" 

Sicili shakes her head, "then they left me alone for a day or two. I don't know how long, the room had no windows. They feed me though. Then someone finally came to talk to me again, I thought it was more questions. Instead he told me that since I was here illegally, they'll have to send me back to Atonia. But if I were to be adopted to a family, then I can stay. I don't think he really ever meant to give me a choice."

"And so they moved you from one jail cell to a jail household?" Vio says rhetorically. "You were adopted so they can hold you hostage against us."

Sicili nods, "I think so."

"We are getting you out tonight," Vio says. "Zaki and I are here on a mission, and after it we might not be able to remain in Galei." She relays the detail of their escape plan to Sicili.

When they finally left the rest room, Vio is reluctant to part with her sister. She's afraid that the moment she lets her out of her sight, she'll never see her again.

"Don't worry, I'll meet you in the stables, just like you told me to," Sicili assures her. 

---

Vio finds Zaki near the coat room, she walks up to him and whispers "She'll be coming with us."

"I'm glad," he says in a low voice. "So I just saw Edgar walk away with a man in a pinstripe suit, let's follow them."

Vio notices the girl at working coat check is looking at them. She stands on her tiptoes, and plants a kiss on his neck. In a very audiable tone says, "I can't wait."

Zaki looks at her a little confused at first, she winks and he winks back. For the rest of the world, they are a couple who just are sneaking off for a few moments alone together. When the crowds in the cooridoor finally thing down, Zaki whispers, "since when did you become such an on the moment actor?"

"Oh you know Ada grows on you," she says.

"Huh," says Zaki. A few minutes later he asks, "so what's the deal with Sicili."

"They are holding her hostage by the adoption," she didn't know how much to tell him. Somehow she felt she shouldn't tell him about the torture. It wasn't her trauma to tell. Plus they had an important job to do tonight, one person enraged is enough. Tonight, she finally understands his desire for retribution. She is steaming from what they did to Sicili, she wants to burn those who had burnt her sister. She wants them to burn alive. 

Zaki stops in front of a door weighted door and quietly opens it. They enter a dark room filled with theatre equipment, "ouch!" He accidently bump into a box. She grabs him from falling.

"Here, follow me," she says and guides him through the room toward where she assumes are the voices of two men arguing. One of the voices she recongized. Vio is amazed that she still can see in the dark. After waking up in Ryker's last week, her senses remain in a heighten awareness. They come up behind the curtains to see who the voices of dispute belong to.

The owner of those voices were their bosses, Jacques _ and Edgar von Essen. They were not strangers to one another. The words they spew carried the pain of history, resentment long held, and the anguish of betrayal. They stand on the small stage in this private theatre, dimly lit by the the emergency lights.

"This is not the better world we imagined!" Jacques says trumbling. "You promised we'll make a better world together. That we can stop Galei's economy from crumbling."

"I'm only one man, there is only so much I can do to hold of the tides of change sweeping our neighboring land," says Edgar.

"You mean The Order's envasion and dethroning ruling powers. Really Galei the most powerful country can't do anything to stop that." Jacques says. "The High Priest may be a power hungry militant, but at least he's trying to make change. He is trying to end suffering by bringing unity."

"And it is their unity that robbed our country of its largest industry." Edgar reasons, "For centuries Galei was prosperous because of the warring city states in Atonia. But since Atonia is now under the Order's control our economy has completely tanked. Towns are left desolate! What do you want me to do? Start up a war?!"

"Isn't that where we are? About to enter into a civil war with The Order?!" Jacques reflects.

"Yes, I suppose we are." Edgar says walking towards the edge of the stage to sit down. "And you are more than willing to join their side just to spite me."

"To spite you? Not everything I do is about you," Jacques remains where he is standing.

"If we go to war with the Order this means we can reopen all those closed factories back up," Edgar reflects.

"There has to be another means for Galei to survive that does not envolve sponsoring bloodshed," says Jacques.

"Still ever the idealist," says Edgar mockingly. "You are so much like your academic advisor, Dr. Attar. Ever the hopeful, so brave, so noble until the very end, all the way up until I pulled that trigger to his head. He didn't even beg."

"You were behind their murder? Why! You know I lost my place in university because of his death." Jacques ask in tears.

"Well... I didn't choose them. But I guess I didn't object when Ross took me there either," Edgar says with a shrug. When he turns around, he finds his forehead had come face to face with the barrel of a handgun.

Jacques tumbles and he holds it. "You've lost the right to speak of the Attars ever again!"

Edgar raises his eyebrows, "never have you killed have you? Let me show you how its done." He caress the back of his old friend's hand, holding it still.

From behind the curtains came a tumble, they both turn to find Vio and Zaki had stumbled out. Zaki with a curved dagger drawn to pointing it a Jacques.

"Get away from him," Zaki demands.

"Oh good you're here," Edgar cheers. "Jacques, I want you to meet my private body guard." Standing up he brushes dust from his slacks.

"Edgar von Essen's life is mine to take," Zaki finishes. With that said he launches himself towards Edgar. Edgar tries to back away, but realizes that he is a the edge of the stage. He tries to side step, but the prime minister his way beyond his prime of physical fitness. Zaki swings the Nunan dagger with all his might through Edgar's neck. In one swoop the prime minister's head deattaches from his body. Zaki pulls back in both figuretively and literally shocked. Electric charge pass through the dagger and unto his wrist, and he drops the dagger. Vio rush to stop him from falling.

Edgar's head rolls across the stage, wires sizzle releasing sparks in blue and white. The same wires from the base heck of the body does the same, before the body surrenders to the force of gravity and falls off stage. From the darkness beyond the stage comes an wave of applause. The lights in the miniature theatre turn out revealing Galeian parliament members who rising from their seats.
