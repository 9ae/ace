By the time she reaches her floor, she could no longer hold back her tears. She does not know how she feels about the information Zaki had told her, but her body is certainly reacting to it. If Sicili is there she wouldn't know what to say to her younger sister, she's never cried in front of her before. Maybe if made a dash into the bathroom Sicili wouldn't notice her eyes. She races through the hallway to her flat.

Sitting outside her front door is Yule. His head resting on his knees. He looks up when she towers over him and abruptly stands up. She can barely react when he does and the two of them stand facing eachother, centimeter apart, faces almost touching. "Sicili," he whispers. "They took her."

Her tears evaporates and whatever resevoir they came from dried up. "What? Took her where? Who they?" she demands.

"Can we go inside? You don't want your neighbors knowing why they took her," he says quitely.

Once inside, Yule takes a seat in their dining table in the kitchen, and she runs to the restroom to wash her face.
