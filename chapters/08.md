> What if we see this scene from Yule's perspective?

By the time she reaches her floor, she could no longer hold back her tears. She does not know how she feels about the information Zaki had told her, but her body is certainly reacting to it. If Sicili is there she wouldn't know what to say to her younger sister, she's never cried in front of her before. Maybe if made a dash into the bathroom Sicili wouldn't notice her eyes. She races through the hallway to her flat.

Sitting outside her front door is Yule. His head resting on his knees. He looks up when she towers over him and abruptly stands up. She can barely react when he does and the two of them stand facing eachother, centimeter apart, faces almost touching. "Sicili," he whispers. "They took her."

Her tears evaporates and whatever resevoir they came from dried up. "What? Took her where? Who they?" she demands.

"Can we go inside? You don't want your neighbors knowing why they took her," he says quitely.

Once inside, Yule takes a seat in their dining table in the kitchen, and she runs to the restroom to rinse her face. Looking up in the mirrors, 

> What does she see? 

They finally sat across from eachother with steeping tea between them. Yule took the courtesy to brew a fresh pot, while Vio was in the washroom. He slowly explais to her how he ran into Sicili the night he came back and after being reprimanded by Roderick, she was there to comfort him. They devised a plan together that would help him regain trust of the High Priest again.

"They captured us both, but technically they didn't have enough evidence to convict us," Yule says. "When they had to create a suspect record for us was when they found out. Vivara are you a registered resident in Galei?"

Vio shakes her head, "Nor is Sici."

"And that is what they got her locked up on," Yule says slowly. "Then they let me go back to The Order, but instead I came here."

"Do you know where they could have taken her?" Vio ask robotically.

"No idea. We were at the station when they took us in, but I am not sure do they hold prisoners there or send them somewhere else."

"Thank you for telling me," she felt obligated to say. When Yule reaches out to hug her, she backs away. Too much has happened for her to be able to find comfort in someone's arms. Especially since the last pair of arms she rested her body in had put their lives at risk for some extra cash.

His makes the finishing stroke with the flutter of her eyelashes. Zaki steps back from the canvas examining his portrait of Sicili Alighieri.  

Proud of his art, he smiles. Everything is falling into place. He is so close in executing justie for his parents. Edgar von Essen is the only one left alive out of the five boys who invaded his house that night. Maybe after completing the mission, he may allow himself to see the happiness he had long denied himself from. For a few moments he allows himself to slip into a day dream.

Him hold a boquet of daisies. Sicili in a sundress. A picnic under the sun. They walk out of the opera house, she smiles in the moonlight. The figure in the moonlight becomes her sister. Vio crying on the balcony of the inn they stayed in Varin. Her quivering lips.

Zaki's reverie is interrupted by the chime of his flat's guest bell. Someone is downstairs, he wonders who could be visiting him on a Sunday. Then he remembers what Edgar said.

Just like he said, a black car with black windows arrives at Zaki's home on Sunday. The driver motions him to get in the backseat, so he did. Inside sits the prime minister in a creme colored suit.

"So have you thought about my offer?" ask Edgar.

"Yes, and I accept," Zaki says.

Edgar claps his hands, "Great! I have a mission for you."

Tonight is an unusual night at the Hart household for it was quiet. Alan is out on a date with Adolf, leaving Ada and Yi han to read after dinner. Ada, in a silk robe, legs extended on the sofa, reads a book about a resurrected dead body trying to understand and find acceptence in this strange world. Yihan scans through the day's newspaper.

"Hey, there will be a meteor shower tomorrow night," Yihan announces. "Do you want to check it out?"

 "Sure," Ada says not looking up from her book. "I'll let Alan know."

"Um," Yihan starts, but uncertain of how to clarify his intentions. "I meant... would it be okay if I want it to be ... just us?"

"But he loves that astronomical events," she replies. After a few moments paused in thought, she finally looks up from her book. With a raised eyebrow ask, "Wait... are you asking me out? Like a date?"

Yihan looks away, turning a little pink and a little angry *'yes, of course I was asking you on a date. What else do you think I meant?!'*

Ada giggles, "haha, I was just messing with you. Of course you won't be asking me on a date. Alan would flip out if he found the two of us dating."

"Oh," Yihan says. "Yea, haha of course it's not a date. Bring Alan and if his boyfriend wants to come too." A little disappointed he turns back to reading the news.

Ada smiles, "they are such cute couple. I wish I coud have someone like that one day." She continues on talking for 10 minutes completely unaware that Yihan wasn't listening. When she realizes that he hasn't said anything, she tosses a cushion at him. It hits him lightly on the shoulder, "are you there?"

Yihan picks it up and tosses it hard back at her, she takes another pillow to throw his way. He gets up from his seat at the desk and she stands on the sofa, a pillow fight commences.

Instead of throwing soft projectiles at eachother, they each pick up a few cushions and circle in on a melee battle. Ada laughs as Yihan tackles her with a cushion, they both fall into the sofa. Ada agains shock advantage as she begins to tickle him, he leaps back. "Hey!"

"Fine, not tickling" she saids with her both of her hands behind her torso. She leans in and surprises him with a cushion she held behind. Despite the immentent "danger", they both close the distance between them. For a long moment, there was no surprise attacks coming from either side. Maybe they move on to a starring contest, Ada holds her breathe as Yihan continues to look a into her eyes.

Yihan finally says softly, "I wouldn't mind you know."

"What?" Ada ask leaning in closer.

He pulls a strand of a hair from her face, "if Alan got mad at us."

"Oh," Ada turns red, trying to deny how much she wants this, but is afraid of making the first step, just in case she is misreading his signals. Because that's happened to her way too many times before, and she always walk away ashamed. Before she can give a proper answer the doorbell rings.

They both part like two north magnet sides. Yihan gets up annoyed, "Argh. Alan forgot his keys again?!"

But it wasn't Alan and Adolf at the door, it was their friend Vio with dark circles under her eyes. She was panting as if she had ran up their stairs, which makes no sense their building had a two sets of perfectly functional elevators.

"What's wrong?" Yihan ask.

"My sister has been taken prisoner. Can you help me find out where she got taken to?" Vio says a hurried slur.

Yihan calls to Ada "better get your computer" as he lets Vio into their flat. 

Vio relays what Yule told her to Yihan and Ada.

"Given what you told us," Yihan says processing. "They arrested her on minor charges, but they did so because she is helping the order so they probably are considering her a political terrorist."

"So she won't be in the county jail," Ada explains. "I think she might be in the Ryker's Facility. That is were they take all terrorist and murderers."

Vio tenses up thinking of her sister amoung the company of dangerous people. Between her and Lessa, Sicili was the only one who was never educated on how to hold her own in a fight. "How do I get her out?" 

"Well, first we'll need to figure out how to get in." Ada says. "They have an entire on-location data base, that is only accessible through their intranet. No one knows anything about the prison, other than those who work there."

"What excuse to you plan on using to go there?" Yihan ask Ada.

"We'll probably have to sneak in," says Ada.

"I'm not so sure..." Yihan starts, but pauses. "Can we speak alone for a bit?"

Ada looks at Vio, "do you mind?"

Vio shakes her head, "No, not at all. Thank you for listening."

After they get to Yihan's room he starts, "You asked me leave Chundu, the only home I knew, because somehow you got exhiled." Ada looks away, swallowing a tense breathe and hopes he will never find out why. "I never asked how, or why. I followed you and your brother to start over here."

Stuttering for the first time, she ask "Do.. do you.... you regret coming with us?"

"No," he says softer. "Being here in Galei was the best thing that happened to me. I love the life we've built together." he takes a hold of her hands in his. "I have a job I'm great at in a country that threats me with respect even though we are not citizens. I can forget that was born a subject to a great colonial empire." As the counts each of the benefits of living in Galei, he strokes his long fingers down her palm. Ada can feel the tingles of his touch, with each stroke making her heart beat a little faster.

"And you are asking e to throw all that away now, once again." Yihan explains. "By helping Vio break her sister out of jail, that's what we'll be risking if we get caught! The life you, Alan, and I have built together in Ixan."

"We won't get caught! I promise." she reassures him.

Yihan peers between his glasses, his eyes hidden by the darkness of the room. They had forgotten to turn on the lights when they walked in. "Can you really promise me that?"

"No I guess not," Ada reflects, but confidently she says, "but even if we do we can find a way to work it out."

Yihan sighs, and begins to chuckle. "How can I forget, you are Adeline Hart, Lady Wickshire. Your family will always bail you out of whatever trouble you get into. Killed a man? We'll let's just pay his loved ones?"

Ada winces, remembering the one time when she did indeed killed a man.

He continues to talk bitterly, "started a riot? They've got your bail! Found conspiring with anarchist against the empire? 'Let's just send her away, until everyone here forgets.'"

"Did you forget I joined the cause to free your people from my government?!" Ada reminds him. "If you don't want to help us with Vio's sister you don't have to. You can just stay out of it!" She had enough of his conversation, and opens his door. Light floods into the room to expose the pool of tears she had in her eyes.

Before she fully steps out, Yihan reminds her "that's what you don't understand. I can't! Who do you think they will question first if you or Alan gets caught for leaking security information?!"

Ada runs to the bathroom, after washing her face, she looks into the mirror. Turning the red gem stone necklace she had always worn several times, it begins to glow, hitting the mirror with it's rogue light. "Alan, Alan. We need you back at the flat."

In less than a minute, her brother's reflection replaces her own in the bathroom mirror. He was dressed in just his briefs. "I'll be back in an hour."

By the time Alan got back, Ada had gathered herself together and was planning in the kitchen with Vio. Yihan remained in his room, sleeping maybe. Yule had also arrived, eager to help rescue Sicili since he largely saw her imprisonment as his fault.

Alan lays down a blue print, "There is not much information about Ryker but I manage to pull this blue print from it's initial construction."

`Scene described with an hold blueprint of the facility`

"So since, the facility's data is an information black box. We must go in ourselves to access it," Yule confirms.

"Right," confirms Vio. "I am already a wanted person, since I've carried out hits on a few politicans. So we can use my capture as an excuse to go in."

"Once we bring her in, they will likely submit her for in-take," says Ada. Turning to her brother, "that's when you hack into the security system to turn the cameras off in the in-take room."

"I can take out the people is registering me into the prison, so you will have outfits to wear," says Vio. "Ada and Yule will stand by. Afterwards Ada will try to find Sicili in their database, and Yule will follow her instructions to rescue Sicili."

"And once we find her, Alan will go down to their electrical room and turn off the power, while we make an escape," Ada finalizes.

"How do we communicate with eachtother while inside?" ask Yule.

Alan brings out a few sets of earrings, "these are audio sets, we can keep in touch this way."

Yule lifts them, and realizes he may the the only one in the crowd without pierced ears. Ada takes notices and smiles, "don't worry about that, you can attach them to your collars."

Yule and Vio nods, they agree to meet tomorrowing evening before nightfall and drive to Ryker's Facility together. Ada tells Vio to come in something dishevealed. The two leave and Alan heads to bed. The sound of typing coming from Yihan's room suggest he might be awake, she she knocks on the door. The typing stops, but no other sound or motion seems to occur. 

"Yihan, are you awake? Can I come in?" she ask softly.

A few moment later, he opens the door. He had changed out of his dress shirt was was wearing a sleeves undershirt. He was no longer wearing glasses.

He steps back as she comes into the room closing the door. Yihan takes a seat on the side of his bed, with his hands folded, elbows resting on his knees. "I'm sorry, I just can't... this time. You are asking too much from me."

She joins him by the bed and whispers, "I know. You don't have to be part of this. And when they ask you, you'll tell them you know nothing." She reaches for his chin to make sure he was looking at her when she said it. "But if anything, happens to me. I want you to promise me, you'll take care of Alan. He's a light this dark world can't afford to lose."

Yihan nods, eyes bright fromt he city's lights. It was just like they were before, buried under a pile of cushions. Ada lets of his chin as she leans in towards his lips. Instead of finding his lips on hers, she bumps against his fingers, she slowly opens hers eyes.

"What are you wearing?" he asks.

"Nothing if you want," she teases.

"No, I mean..." he lips his fingers to show the violet gloss he pulled from her lips.

"Forgetful toxin," she explains. "You will not remember the next few hours. So if they do come questioning you, you won't know anything. And you won't be lying."

"Will it even work on me?" Yihan ask. "I can't forget. Somehow my brain doesn't sort away memories."

"I am not sure," she says.

He pull her to him again, "let's find out." His tongue licks away the glossy toxin from her lips. Ada shivers, eager to pull him closer but he pulls away. After swallowing he says, "you better go. If this toxin does work, I wouldn't want to wake up next to you, not remembering... our first night together, I want to remember that for the rest of my life."

"Knowing you, you probably will," Ada says slowly standing up. 

As she is about to head out, he calls out "and I promise. To keep Alan safe, if anything were to happen to you. But please don't let that happen, we have a meteor shower to watch when you get back tomorrow night."

Ada smiles and nods as she leaves the room.

---

Ada was sipping coffee, while Alan was making pancakes. Yihan finally comes out of his bedroom, "I might as well join you guys tonight, because I still remember what we talked about last night."

Ada smiles, she can't even though it wasn't important in the grand scheme of their safety, she was happy that he still remembers the intimate moments they shared last night. She knew it was risk, when she put the memory toxin in ther lip gloss. But it was a risk she had to take to keep him safe.

"So, how can I help?" Yihan ask.

When Yule drove up to Ryker's Facility it wasn't what any of them had expected. Well they didn't know what to expect since none of them had ever seen it, but from the blueprints they studied, they imagine it to look like this. Ryker's Facility for Criminal Rehabitation was on the far east side a little beyond Ixan's city limits. It was surrounded by a forest of pine trees, the facility itself is situationed on a clearing. The clearing is lined with immaculate green grass. Behind the trees, the sun starts to descend.

The main building is white, with Atonian facades decorating its arches and corners. There was a stable, several gardens, and even a green house. Prisoners and nurses gathered around the garden, there was a field where prisoners played football. 

Yule pulls up to a sign that says designated visitor's area. It had ample parking space for both motor vechiles and horse carriages. Once parked, he looks in the rearview mirror, where Vio has her hands tied behind her with handcuffs, Ada and Yihan sat on either side of her. "Ready?" he asks them.

Ada and Yihan were natural born actors, but Vio not so much. She could barely tell a white lie, luckily she didn't have to do much in this role but glare. They got out the car, and brings Vio up to the facility's security desk.

"Excuse us," Ada starts. The nurse at the security desk looks up, and Ada cracks her flirty half smile. She holds our her badge, and says "ICED Security, we have a wanted criminal. The castrating hit-woman, known to the public as Ace."

The nurse looks shocked, and Vio pulls her face in the best imitation of a demented grin she could muster. "Oh my, let me get the intake team. Is she...?"

"Constrained?" says Yihan. "Yes of course. She'll be no danger to you, miss."

In a few minutes a man in a security uniform and another nurse shows up to take Vio into a room beyond several series of bars. Ada walks up to the nurse asks, "Before we go, do you mind pointing us to the restroom. We've been driving hours to get here and..."

The nurse directs them to the guest bathrooms with the motion of her fingers. They hallway they walk down had salmon pink walls, lit by greenish florescent lights. Ada and Yihan each goes into separate rooms and wait.

Meanwile Vio was being lead down with another florescent light hallway, this one had a tint of yellow. She tries to calm herself by syncing her heartbeat to the vibrations of the light. She could also hear Alan's keyboard clattering through her ear piece, and Yule telling her that Ada and Yihan are now in place waiting for her. The attendants lead her into a room, with no windows and a solid steel door. At the corner of one ceiling is a camera, which she looks up at. 

"Ok, I see you," Alan says. "But give me a few seconds to take control of it."

When they demanded she strip down, she just stood here. After a few more commands, the guard pushed her down as the nurse made her way to undress Vio. She pretends to struggle against their grip.

"Okay, ready" Alan says. Vio could see the recording light on the security camera turn off. The workers were too busy struggling with her to notice. As they remove her cloth, two sharp wooden stakes strapped to her calves is revealed.

> Injects them both with Zaki's sleep venom

She grabs them stabs the guard's neck, making sure to not get his uniform stained. The nurse backs away, she knocks her unconscious with the dolly frame. With both of her captors unconscious, she fully undresses. With eagerness she puts on the prisoner's uniform, already laid out there for her on the dolly. She undresses, the guard and the nurse carefully. "Ada, I'm all set."

Ada and Yihan exit the bathroom and follow Alan's instructions to find the processing room where Vio is waiting for them.

In the room where they changed, Vio turns her head towards the doors and Ada and Yihan occupy opposite sides of the wall. When Yihan is done, he turns around to find Ada still hasn't gotten her top on yet. For the _ years he's been with the Hart siblings, they considered him their brother. He's seen the both in various stats of undressed many times. But he wonders if anything were to happen on this mission, will it be the last time he sees Ada's milky shoulders. When she is finally dressed she turns around. The shirt was little too small for her broad shoulders and fullsome cup. A few buttons on her nurse's shirt were threatening to pop.

The three nod to eachother, Ada and Yihan helps Vio fasten the straps on her straight jacket prisone'rs uniform.
