> What if we see this scene from Yule's perspective?

By the time she reaches her floor, she could no longer hold back her tears. She does not know how she feels about the information Zaki had told her, but her body is certainly reacting to it. If Sicili is there she wouldn't know what to say to her younger sister, she's never cried in front of her before. Maybe if made a dash into the bathroom Sicili wouldn't notice her eyes. She races through the hallway to her flat.

Sitting outside her front door is Yule. His head resting on his knees. He looks up when she towers over him and abruptly stands up. She can barely react when he does and the two of them stand facing eachother, centimeter apart, faces almost touching. "Sicili," he whispers. "They took her."

Her tears evaporates and whatever resevoir they came from dried up. "What? Took her where? Who they?" she demands.

"Can we go inside? You don't want your neighbors knowing why they took her," he says quitely.

Once inside, Yule takes a seat in their dining table in the kitchen, and she runs to the restroom to rinse her face. Looking up in the mirrors, 

> What does she see? 

They finally sat across from eachother with steeping tea between them. Yule took the courtesy to brew a fresh pot, while Vio was in the washroom. He slowly explais to her how he ran into Sicili the night he came back and after being reprimanded by Roderick, she was there to comfort him. They devised a plan together that would help him regain trust of the High Priest again.

"They captured us both, but technically they didn't have enough evidence to convict us," Yule says. "When they had to create a suspect record for us was when they found out. Vivara are you a registered resident in Galei?"

Vio shakes her head, "Nor is Sici."

"And that is what they got her locked up on," Yule says slowly. "Then they let me go back to The Order, but instead I came here."

"Do you know where they could have taken her?" Vio ask robotically.

"No idea. We were at the station when they took us in, but I am not sure do they hold prisoners there or send them somewhere else."

"Thank you for telling me," she felt obligated to say. When Yule reaches out to hug her, she backs away. Too much has happened for her to be able to find comfort in someone's arms. Especially since the last pair of arms she rested her body in had put their lives at risk for some extra cash.

His makes the finishing stroke with the flutter of her eyelashes. Zaki steps back from the canvas examining his portrait of Sicili Alighieri.  

Proud of his art, he smiles. Everything is falling into place. He is so close in executing justie for his parents. Edgar von Essen is the only one left alive out of the five boys who invaded his house that night. Maybe after completing the mission, he may allow himself to see the happiness he had long denied himself from. For a few moments he allows himself to slip into a day dream.

Him hold a boquet of daisies. Sicili in a sundress. A picnic under the sun. They walk out of the opera house, she smiles in the moonlight. The figure in the moonlight becomes her sister. Vio crying on the balcony of the inn they stayed in Varin. Her quivering lips.

Zaki's reverie is interrupted by the chime of his flat's guest bell. Someone is downstairs, he wonders who could be visiting him on a Sunday. Then he remembers what Edgar said.

Just like he said, a black car with black windows arrives at Zaki's home on Sunday. The driver motions him to get in the backseat, so he did. Inside sits the prime minister in a creme colored suit.

"So have you thought about my offer?" ask Edgar.

"Yes, and I accept," Zaki says.

Edgar claps his hands, "Great! I have a mission for you."

Tonight is an unusual night at the Hart household for it was quiet. Alan is out on a date with Adolf, leaving Ada and Yi han to read after dinner. Ada, in a silk robe, legs extended on the sofa, reads a book about a resurrected dead body trying to understand and find acceptence in this strange world. Yihan scans through the day's newspaper.

"Hey, there will be a meteor shower tomorrow night," Yihan announces. "Do you want to check it out?"

 "Sure," Ada says not looking up from her book. "I'll let Alan know."

"Um," Yihan starts, but uncertain of how to clarify his intentions. "I meant... would it be okay if I want it to be ... just us?"

"But he loves that astronomical events," she replies. After a few moments paused in thought, she finally looks up from her book. With a raised eyebrow ask, "Wait... are you asking me out? Like a date?"

Yihan looks away, turning a little pink and a little angry *'yes, of course I was asking you on a date. What else do you think I meant?!'*

Ada giggles, "haha, I was just messing with you. Of course you won't be asking me on a date. Alan would flip out if he found the two of us dating."

"Oh," Yihan says. "Yea, haha of course it's not a date. Bring Alan and if his boyfriend wants to come too." A little disappointed he turns back to reading the news.

Ada smiles, "they are such cute couple. I wish I coud have someone like that one day." She continues on talking for 10 minutes completely unaware that Yihan wasn't listening. When she realizes that he hasn't said anything, she tosses a cushion at him. It hits him lightly on the shoulder, "are you there?"

Yihan picks it up and tosses it hard back at her, she takes another pillow to throw his way. He gets up from his seat at the desk and she stands on the sofa, a pillow fight commences.

Instead of throwing soft projectiles at eachother, they each pick up a few cushions and circle in on a melee battle. Ada laughs as Yihan tackles her with a cushion, they both fall into the sofa. Ada agains shock advantage as she begins to tickle him, he leaps back. "Hey!"

"Fine, not tickling" she saids with her both of her hands behind her torso. She leans in and surprises him with a cushion she held behind. Despite the immentent "danger", they both close the distance between them. For a long moment, there was no surprise attacks coming from either side. Maybe they move on to a starring contest, Ada holds her breathe as Yihan continues to look a into her eyes.

Yihan finally says softly, "I wouldn't mind you know."

"What?" Ada ask leaning in closer.

He pulls a strand of a hair from her face, "if Alan got mad at us."

"Oh," Ada turns red, trying to deny how much she wants this, but is afraid of making the first step, just in case she is misreading his signals. Because that's happened to her way too many times before, and she always walk away ashamed. Before she can give a proper answer the doorbell rings.

They both part like two north magnet sides. Yihan gets up annoyed, "Argh. Alan forgot his keys again?!"

But it wasn't Alan and Adolf at the door, it was their friend Vio with dark circles under her eyes. She was panting as if she had ran up their stairs, which makes no sense their building had a two sets of perfectly functional elevators.

"What's wrong?" Yihan ask.

"My sister has been taken prisoner. Can you help me find out where she got taken to?" Vio says a hurried slur.

Yihan calls to Ada "better get your computer" as he lets Vio into their flat. 

Vio relays what Yule told her to Yihan and Ada.

"Given what you told us," Yihan says processing. "They arrested her on minor charges, but they did so because she is helping the order so they probably are considering her a political terrorist."

"So she won't be in the county jail," Ada explains. "I think she might be in the Ryker's Facility. That is were they take all terrorist and murderers."

Vio tenses up thinking of her sister amoung the company of dangerous people. Between her and Lessa, Sicili was the only one who was never educated on how to hold her own in a fight. "How do I get her out?" 

"Well, first we'll need to figure out how to get in." Ada says. "They have an entire on-location data base, that is only accessible through their intranet. No one knows anything about the prison, other than those who work there."

"What excuse to you plan on using to go there?" Yihan ask Ada.

"We'll probably have to sneak in," says Ada.

"I'm not so sure..." Yihan starts, but pauses. "Can we speak alone for a bit?"

Ada looks at Vio, "do you mind?"

Vio shakes her head, "No, not at all. Thank you for listening."

After they get to Yihan's room he starts, "You asked me leave Chundu, the only home I knew, because somehow you got exhiled." Ada looks away, swallowing a tense breathe and hopes he will never find out why. "I never asked how, or why. I followed you and your brother to start over here."

Stuttering for the first time, she ask "Do.. do you.... you regret coming with us?"

"No," he says softer. "Being here in Galei was the best thing that happened to me. I love the life we've built together." he takes a hold of her hands in his. "I have a job I'm great at in a country that threats me with respect even though we are not citizens. I can forget that was born a subject to a great colonial empire." As the counts each of the benefits of living in Galei, he strokes his long fingers down her palm. Ada can feel the tingles of his touch, with each stroke making her heart beat a little faster.

"And you are asking e to throw all that away now, once again." Yihan explains. "By helping Vio break her sister out of jail, that's what we'll be risking if we get caught! The life you, Alan, and I have built together in Ixan."

"We won't get caught! I promise." she reassures him.

Yihan peers between his glasses, his eyes hidden by the darkness of the room. They had forgotten to turn on the lights when they walked in. "Can you really promise me that?"

"No I guess not," Ada reflects, but confidently she says, "but even if we do we can find a way to work it out."

Yihan sighs, and begins to chuckle. "How can I forget, you are Adeline Hart, Lady Wickshire. Your family will always bail you out of whatever trouble you get into. Killed a man? We'll let's just pay his loved ones?"

Ada winces, remembering the one time when she did indeed killed a man.

He continues to talk bitterly, "started a riot? They've got your bail! Found conspiring with anarchist against the empire? 'Let's just send her away, until everyone here forgets.'"

"Did you forget I joined the cause to free your people from my government?!" Ada reminds him. "If you don't want to help us with Vio's sister you don't have to. You can just stay out of it!" She had enough of his conversation, and opens his door. Light floods into the room to expose the pool of tears she had in her eyes.

Before she fully steps out, Yihan reminds her "that's what you don't understand. I can't! Who do you think they will question first if you or Alan gets caught for leaking security information?!"

Ada runs to the bathroom, after washing her face, she looks into the mirror. Turning the red gem stone necklace she had always worn several times, it begins to glow, hitting the mirror with it's rogue light. "Alan, Alan. We need you back at the flat."

In less than a minute, her brother's reflection replaces her own in the bathroom mirror. He was dressed in just his briefs. "I'll be back in an hour."

By the time Alan got back, Ada had gathered herself together and was planning in the kitchen with Vio. Yihan remained in his room, sleeping maybe. Yule had also arrived, eager to help rescue Sicili since he largely saw her imprisonment as his fault.

Alan lays down a blue print, "There is not much information about Ryker but I manage to pull this blue print from it's initial construction."

`Scene described with an hold blueprint of the facility`

"So since, the facility's data is an information black box. We must go in ourselves to access it," Yule confirms.

"Right," confirms Vio. "I am already a wanted person, since I've carried out hits on a few politicans. So we can use my capture as an excuse to go in."

"Once we bring her in, they will likely submit her for in-take," says Ada. Turning to her brother, "that's when you hack into the security system to turn the cameras off in the in-take room."

"I can take out the people is registering me into the prison, so you will have outfits to wear," says Vio. "Ada and Yule will stand by. Afterwards Ada will try to find Sicili in their database, and Yule will follow her instructions to rescue Sicili."

"And once we find her, Alan will go down to their electrical room and turn off the power, while we make an escape," Ada finalizes.

"How do we communicate with eachtother while inside?" ask Yule.

Alan brings out a few sets of earrings, "these are audio sets, we can keep in touch this way."

Yule lifts them, and realizes he may the the only one in the crowd without pierced ears. Ada takes notices and smiles, "don't worry about that, you can attach them to your collars."
