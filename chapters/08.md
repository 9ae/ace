> What if we see this scene from Yule's perspective?

By the time she reaches her floor, she could no longer hold back her tears. She does not know how she feels about the information Zaki had told her, but her body is certainly reacting to it. If Sicili is there she wouldn't know what to say to her younger sister, she's never cried in front of her before. Maybe if made a dash into the bathroom Sicili wouldn't notice her eyes. She races through the hallway to her flat.

Sitting outside her front door is Yule. His head resting on his knees. He looks up when she towers over him and abruptly stands up. She can barely react when he does and the two of them stand facing eachother, centimeter apart, faces almost touching. "Sicili," he whispers. "They took her."

Her tears evaporates and whatever resevoir they came from dried up. "What? Took her where? Who they?" she demands.

"Can we go inside? You don't want your neighbors knowing why they took her," he says quitely.

Once inside, Yule takes a seat in their dining table in the kitchen, and she runs to the restroom to rinse her face. Looking up in the mirrors, 

> What does she see? 

They finally sat across from eachother with steeping tea between them. Yule took the courtesy to brew a fresh pot, while Vio was in the washroom. He slowly explais to her how he ran into Sicili the night he came back and after being reprimanded by Roderick, she was there to comfort him. They devised a plan together that would help him regain trust of the High Priest again.

"They captured us both, but technically they didn't have enough evidence to convict us," Yule says. "When they had to create a suspect record for us was when they found out. Vivara are you a registered resident in Galei?"

Vio shakes her head, "Nor is Sici."

"And that is what they got her locked up on," Yule says slowly. "Then they let me go back to The Order, but instead I came here."

"Do you know where they could have taken her?" Vio ask robotically.

"No idea. We were at the station when they took us in, but I am not sure do they hold prisoners there or send them somewhere else."

"Thank you for telling me," she felt obligated to say. When Yule reaches out to hug her, she backs away. Too much has happened for her to be able to find comfort in someone's arms. Especially since the last pair of arms she rested her body in had put their lives at risk for some extra cash.

His makes the finishing stroke with the flutter of her eyelashes. Zaki steps back from the canvas examining his portrait of Sicili Alighieri.  

Proud of his art, he smiles. Everything is falling into place. He is so close in executing justie for his parents. Edgar von Essen is the only one left alive out of the five boys who invaded his house that night. Maybe after completing the mission, he may allow himself to see the happiness he had long denied himself from. For a few moments he allows himself to slip into a day dream.

Him hold a boquet of daisies. Sicili in a sundress. A picnic under the sun. They walk out of the opera house, she smiles in the moonlight. The figure in the moonlight becomes her sister. Vio crying on the balcony of the inn they stayed in Varin. Her quivering lips.

Zaki's reverie is interrupted by the chime of his flat's guest bell. Someone is downstairs, he wonders who could be visiting him on a Sunday. Then he remembers what Edgar said.

Just like he said, a black car with black windows arrives at Zaki's home on Sunday. The driver motions him to get in the backseat, so he did. Inside sits the prime minister in a creme colored suit.

"So have you thought about my offer?" ask Edgar.

"Yes, and I accept," Zaki says.

Edgar claps his hands, "Great! I have a mission for you."

Tonight is an unusual night at the Hart household for it was quiet. Alan is out on a date with Adolf, leaving Ada and Yi han to read after dinner. Ada, in a silk robe, legs extended on the sofa, reads a book about a resurrected dead body trying to understand and find acceptence in this strange world. Yihan scans through the day's newspaper.

"Hey, there will be a meteor shower tomorrow night," Yihan announces. "Do you want to check it out?"

 "Sure," Ada says not looking up from her book. "I'll let Alan know."

"Um," Yihan starts, but uncertain of how to clarify his intentions. "I meant... would it be okay if I want it to be ... just us?"

"But he loves that astronomical events," she replies. After a few moments paused in thought, she finally looks up from her book. With a raised eyebrow ask, "Wait... are you asking me out? Like a date?"

Yihan looks away, turning a little pink and a little angry *'yes, of course I was asking you on a date. What else do you think I meant?!'*

Ada giggles, "haha, I was just messing with you. Of course you won't be asking me on a date. Alan would flip out if he found the two of us dating."

"Oh," Yihan says. "Yea, haha of course it's not a date. Bring Alan and if his boyfriend wants to come too." A little disappointed he turns back to reading the news.

Ada smiles, "they are such cute couple. I wish I coud have someone like that one day." She continues on talking for 10 minutes completely unaware that Yihan wasn't listening. When she realizes that he hasn't said anything, she tosses a cushion at him. It hits him lightly on the shoulder, "are you there?"

Yihan picks it up and tosses it hard back at her, she takes another pillow to throw his way. He gets up from his seat at the desk and she stands on the sofa, a pillow fight commences.

Instead of throwing soft projectiles at eachother, they each pick up a few cushions and circle in on a melee battle. Ada laughs as Yihan tackles her with a cushion, they both fall into the sofa. Ada agains shock advantage as she begins to tickle him, he leaps back. "Hey!"

"Fine, not tickling" she saids with her both of her hands behind her torso. She leans in and surprises him with a cushion she held behind. Despite the immentent "danger", they both close the distance between them. For a long moment, there was no surprise attacks coming from either side. Maybe they move on to a starring contest, Ada holds her breathe as Yihan continues to look a into her eyes.

Yihan finally says softly, "I wouldn't mind you know."

"What?" Ada ask leaning in closer.

He pulls a strand of a hair from her face, "if Alan got mad at us."

"Oh," Ada turns red, trying to deny how much she wants this, but is afraid of making the first step, just in case she is misreading his signals. Because that's happened to her way too many times before, and she always walk away ashamed. Before she can give a proper answer the doorbell rings.

They both part like two north magnet sides. Yihan gets up annoyed, "Argh. Alan forgot his keys again?!"

But it wasn't Alan and Adolf at the door, it was their friend Vio with dark circles under her eyes. She was panting as if she had ran up their stairs, which makes no sense their building had a two sets of perfectly functional elevators.
