The sun streams its rays through the window of a empty room. Ada can't recall when was the last time the sun had shined here, since Yihan always had his curtains down. Last night when Vio and Yule finally rejoined them at the car, it was late. So Yule offered everyone a place to say in the guest suites of the cathedral. By the time Alan and Ada returned to their flat this morning Yihan and all his belongings are gone.

She steps inside, feeling the sunlight through the glass burn on her skin. The room still smells of the body freshener he uses, cloves and cucumber. She walks towards the curtains and wraps them around her arms as she sinks down to the ground.

Ada stays in Yihan's room like this for a while, she isn't sure how long. Maybe twenty minutes, maybe a few hours. She runs through her memories for the moments they've shared together over the pass four years. In and out of faking, she drifts... if only she can bottle all these moments into her dreams. The loud buzz of a doorbell breaks her out of reverie.

At the door, she finds her brother's boyfriend. "Oh hi, Alan's in his room."
