The sun streams its rays through the window of a empty room. Ada can't recall when was the last time the sun had shined here, since Yihan always had his curtains down. Last night when Vio and Yule finally rejoined them at the car, it was late. So Yule offered everyone a place to say in the guest suites of the cathedral. By the time Alan and Ada returned to their flat this morning Yihan and all his belongings are gone.

She steps inside, feeling the sunlight through the glass burn on her skin. The room still smells of the body freshener he uses, cloves and cucumber. She walks towards the curtains and wraps them around her arms as she sinks down to the ground.

Ada stays in Yihan's room like this for a while, she isn't sure how long. Maybe twenty minutes, maybe a few hours. She runs through her memories for the moments they've shared together over the pass four years. In and out of faking, she drifts... if only she can bottle all these moments into her dreams. The loud buzz of a doorbell breaks her out of reverie.

At the door, she finds her brother's boyfriend. "Good morning!" he greets her cheerfully. She backs away from the door, letting Adolf steps in.

"Are you feeling ill?" Adolf ask.

"No. Do I look ill?" says Ada.

"You look...", Adolf says. '*vacant? Like you a trying to hold yourself together by loose threads.*' "You look a bit spaced out."

y"Oh, we just had a long night," she answers. "Alan in this room, by the way."

Adolf takes this as a cue that she no longer wants to talk about what's troubling her, and went to the bedroom. Alan had been hitting a punching bag dangling from the ceiling when Adolf comes in. His undershirt clung to his chest glossy with sweat. It look Adolf some restraint to not tackle Alan to his bed. And it took Alan several throws to notice someone had come in. "Oh! Sorry I didn't hear you come in."

"Man, what's with you two today. Your sister seems rather distracted when she answer the door. Is Yihan in the clouds too?" ask Adolf.

Alan replies by holding onto a long silence. Taking off his gloves he hits the punching bag one last time with his bare fist.

"Oh god! Is he alright? Is that why you two are," Adolf says.

"He's alive... and I think safe," Alan explains. "He left us last night."

"What do you mean left?" Adolf ask. And Alan tells in everything. How they tried to rescue Sicili, how at the end of their mission, Yihan announces that he will be servering connection with the Harts. When he finally finished, Adolf had very little to say... "oh man. What a night. But I feel there's something missing..."

"Maybe. But he made his choice, and I so I'm going to respect that," says Alan. "Oh to happier things. Are you working the upcoming Saturday?"

"No, why? Do you have something special in mind?" Adolf whispers into Alan's neck/

Alan chuckles in a low tone he rarely uses. "Well, there's this ball. I think a governor is going to announce someone their family is adopting or something. And I would like you to be my date?"

"It's a ball, and public officials will be there?" ask Adolf.

"Yes, a very public event. If you don't mind? It will be nice for us to be seen our in public for once," says Alan.

"Then a lot of people who are my clients and their family will be there," Adolf explains. "People will talk about the company you keep."

"I don't care," says Alan, pushing a few strands of hair from Adolf's forehead. "I want the whole world to know, but firstly I want you to know. I love you."

Adolf didn't know what to say, it's the only time anyone has said those words to him outside the throws of passion. He kisses Alan, who presses back. When they finally parted lips, Adolf takes this chance to pull hair from Alan's face, "I love you too." They kiss again, this time longer. For hours they wrap themselves in the other person.

By the time they are taking again, the sun is setting. Adolf starts, "I'm still not sure, if I'll be ready to come as your date."

"Ok, I guess.. you're not ready," Alan stumbles with his words a little disappointed and uncertain.

"But I do want us to be seen in public together," Adolf reassures him. "Maybe we can start with something public, but not in a room with public figures?"

"Adolf _, would you like to go to the New Year's Philoharmonic with me?" Alan ask an offical sounding voice to tease him

"Alan Hart, Lord of Wickshire, there nowhere I'd rather be than at the orchestra with you," giggles Adolf, laying another kiss on the sweetest man in the world.

Yule had been staying with Vio since they got back from their failed mission. He didn't trust his adoptive little sister to not do something irrational in the search of her actual younger sister. This is a rare evening in which Vio didn't have to go to work tonight, so they can eat dinner at a leisurely pace. The television is tuned in to the evening news, as he tries to make conversation while she twirls her spaghetti around her fork.

"Are you trying to make yarn balls with those?" Yule ask jokingly. No reply. He gets back to eating his own food. With Sicili gone, there's no cook in the house, and their takeout containers are piled high.

The TV anchor talks about one of the governors who doesn't have children is adopting a sixteen year old into her family. The footage shows a picture of a woman and her wife, with a brunette girl waving at the crew of reporters. "What is notable is the girl before was an illegal resident, performing terrorist acts for The Order. By adopting her, she can now become a legal citizen of Galei and stay here leading a normal life. They are saying to the people of Galei, we can help you in ways The High Priest never can. Miss, how do you feel about their extension of kindness?"

"I am ever so grateful that Nadine and Sakina have decided to take me in," she says softly.

Vio suddenly looks up, because she recognized the voice. And right before her eyes, staring at her in black and white and grainly dots is her very own sister. About to become a member of another family. Maybe this is for the best, Sicili will live a happier live under the care. Their entire mission into Ryker's facility had been a waste of time, and she cost the Harts their long time friend.

The her doorbell jingles, she turns her head towards it but makes no motion to stand up. "I'll get it," Yule announces. Yule opens the door to Zaki standing there, gone is his usual trench coat, instead he wore a black turtleneck sweater and brown slacks. "Sorry, we aren't talking to traitors today," Yule is about to close the door on his face.

"Wait, it's about Sicili!" Zaki calls out holding his hand on the door. "I think she is..."

"Being adopted by a governor?" Yule says sarcastically. "Yea, we know." He opens the door wider to reveal they are watching the broadcast.

Zaki takes this opportunity to step in, completely ignoring Yule he address Vio. "I can get you a chance to talk to her. But I will also neeed your help."

Vio looks at him for a few seconds, and finally stands up leveling herself to his eye level, replies "what do you have in mind?"

---

Vio takes Zaki to the roof of her building, while Yule cleans up dinner. They look out into lights on the bridges overlooking the river. Zaki lays out the explanation, he meant to give. He told her about his parents death, and how he's been trying to get close to Edgar for years.

"Therefore I decided to take up the job in Varin," he says.

"To get into the prime minister's good graces," Vio says. "And now that you have, you've even been invited to this ball. You think it's the chance to do it."

It is starting to get cold, Vio rubs her arms with her arms. When Zaki extended his harms to bring her under the warmth of his sweater she backs away and continues to rub her arms.

Zaki nods, "and I need your help. He may still have one or two guards with him, and the _ mansion is not a very heavily monitored place. I plan to do it peacefully, drop venom into his wine. But I want him to know, it is I who did it."

"If that is how you plan to kill him. Why do you need me? I'm a much messier killer than you," Vio says. 

"If everything goes according to plan, then maybe your skills won't be necessary. And you'll just be a beautiful woman in my arms," he says with a sheepish grin.

Vio blushes, imagining what it would be like if they really were what they appear to be showing to the world. If they weren't there to kill the prime minister, if they were really a couple attending a ball together. But he wouldn't be here if it wasn't for his mission. They are not a couple, what they are killers, each with an objective of their own. She turns away while still speaking, "My skills are the only reason you are here. You definitely need me to do more than smile, because people have told me that my smile is terrifying."

"Depends on when, you do seem pretty cheerful when shoving your knife into someone's chest," tease Zaki. "But we shouldn't come to that, for the first few hours I'll monitor Edgar closely. You can use that time to talk to Sicili."

"Once it's safe to proceed, we'll let eachother know," Zaki explains.

"How do we know let eachtoher know?" Vio ask.

Zaki walks up to her with his hand in a lose fist, his knuckles glide up the side of her neck. Lightly catching the lobe of her ears in between his fingers he gives her ears a gentle hug. He smiles, Vio acknowleding the signal does the same on to him. He surpresses a groan by closing his eyes to let out a deep breathe. They both stand in this position for a while, holding onto eachother's ears. "Then for the actual ask?" Vio ask popping their bubble. 

"We've always worked better together when we play by ear," he says, he chuckles a little at his own pun. Vio does not find it funny. She steps back leaning against the railing, she rocks her body back and forth. Zaki continues, "but I have our getaway plan in place. The ball ends at midnight, people will start going home about an hour before. We want to sneak out before then, so at 10:30 a carriage will come for us. It's supplied with several days worth of living supplies, just in case we need to get away and hide out for a while."

Vio turns looking at him directly in the eye for the first time since she shut the door on him a few days ago, asks "will Sicili be able to come with us if it turns out she's coerced into this adoption?"

"Yes, of course," says Zaki.

"Okay, count me in," Vio annoucnes.

Zaki smiles. "Lastly, what color dress will you be wearing Saturday? I'll get you a flower to match."

"I don't own a dress," Vio realizes.

---

Normally clothing shopping is something Vio will enlist the help of her sister, but Sicili is not around to give encouraging advice. Her only female friend, Helga is in Ivonne. When Vio called Ada, Alan picked up and told her she wasn't feeling well. He was however delighted to hear that she too will be attending the ball. She wanders the store,  running her hands through a rack of dress barely paying attention of any of them. An sale's woman comes up to her, "Miss can I help you to day?"

Vio curses under her breathe, she hates having to interact with sales people. They make her feel rushed. If she doesn't even know what she is looking for how does she tell other people what she needs?! Not to mention, she has trouble accepting "help" from others. Not even looking up to make eye contact, she mutters "No, I'm just browsing."

"Are you sure?" She asks.

'Yes, please go away.' Vio thinks. But before she can be rude to the lady, the wind chimes at the entrance rings and a woman in a white fur coat and ornate hat walks in. The sales lady bothering her, immediately steps away to great the new, and hopefully more socially inclined customer, "Madame Rosseau! It's so nice to see you!"

Vio turns your head down and continues half heartedly looking for a dress. After a few more racks of browsing, a shadow cast upon her vision. "Never thought I'll see you here," Juliette Rosseau says to Vio.

"Madame," Vio breathes out. She doesn't know what else to say, especially since the last time she and this woman came face to face Vio was blackmailing this woman.

Juliette Rooseau smilies, trying to ease the tension, "I think this will look stunning on you." She holds up a slim dress, black with blue and violet tool weaved into the pattern of a _ butterfly's wings.

Of course Madame has an eye for finding outfits befitting of other woman. The dress indeed is beautiful, so beautiful she has a hard time imagining it on herself. Sicili, maybe. But it might be a little too revealing for her sister's modest taste. Then again what does she know of her sister.

"Lessa had one similar. Everytime she wore it..." Juliette reflects, as if lost in memory of her late lover.

"My cousin made everyone drop to her knees, everytime she entered a room, regardless of what she was wearing." Vio says flatly. "She could have been in a hazardous materials suit, and people will still bow to her beautiful. She was powerful that way."

Juliette laughs, "yea you're, right. Have you found out who was her killer yet?"

The question kicked her in the stomach. She's been so wrapped up with work and then Sicili lately. "No, I haven't."

"When you do, make them suffer," Juliette says with a wink. "So I think the castrating assassin will kill in this dress. Why don't you try it on?"

Before she could object Juliette rushed her to the dressing room. Vio looks at the mirror after she puts it on. She wonders is this how Juliette gets girls to work for her, by putting them in dresses that takes their breath away.

"When you are ready let's see it." Juliette calls taking a poof from her cigarette holder.

Vio steps through the curtains, Juliette stands up. "Not bad." Vio looks nervously at the "No Smoking" sign, Juliette follows her glaze.

"Oh, don't worry about that," Juliette explains. "The owner and I go way back. We'll what do you think?"

"I..." Vio starts.

"love it!" Juliette speaks for her. She motions for the sales lady to come, and commands her to wrap this dress up for Vio.

"Thank you Madame," Vio says bowing as they walk out of the shop. "I don't know how I can ever..."

"If you want to thank me, kill that bastard for me," Juliette demands. And with that Madame Juliette Rosseau swaggers away.

A triad of irises tied to Vio's left wrist, her other hand looks into Zaki's arms as they pass through the gates of _ mansion. Balls and parties were remants of her past life in Atonia, a family obligation she never thought she'll have to endure again. Zaki hand combed his normal messy shoulder length mock, into a neat bun. He wore a grey waist coat with dark shirt. She added a corset of her dress, the steel frame of it help conceal the indent of two knifes she hid inside.

They both feel out of place, the ballroom was filled with people who they spent years avoiding and hiding from. To stand under the glaring new electric chandeliers feels exposed. Vio grips on to Zaki tighter and she can feel him stiff.

Who didn't look out of place are the Harts. Alan in a cream suit and lavendar tie, holds a glass of champange in each hand talking excitedly to tall man in a heather grey jacket. Ada draws a smile with her lips, as she walks up to them. She is wearing a black dress with roses embroidered up from the hem. "Sorry, I couldn't go dress shopping with you. Looks like you did pretty alright without my help." She scans Vio a few times up and down.

"Yes, I was rather surprised myself. Who knew the girl with a knife can clean up so nice." Zaki says.

Vio turns a bit pink. She turns away and scans the room for a her sister as Ada and Zaki talk. Sicili nor the woman who adopted her seem to be in sight. Starting to be worried that she had been lead tricked into coming here, or what if Sicili wasn't going to show up and she had done all this preparation for nothing.

"You look like you can tear his arm off," Alan says loudly as he hands one drink in his hand to his sister.

"Oh," Vio finally lets go of Zaki. Wanting still to look around more, she excuses herself to the restroom. Ada offers to take her, but she declined the offer. She never understood the ritual of women going to the toliet together.

"So, you are the mystery man she's been seeing," Alan tease after Vio left.

A little caught off guard, Zaki stutters, "has she said a lot about me?"

"Just that you're bad news," Ada winks. From the corner of her eye, she notices there's a man in his mid thirties looking at their group for longer than just a passing cursory glance. Does she know him? Maybe he's one of Zaki's friends? But his attention seems more focused on her and her brother. He could be someone Alan had worked with, while she and Yihan often stuck together on assignments. Alan's skill set is different and often gets sent tasks to do on his own or with other members of the intelligence department.

When Zaki excuses himself to look for Vio, Ada sides closer to her brother and whispers. "That man over there in the dark green tailcoat, do you know him?"

"No, should I?" Alan says.

"He's been watching us for the last three ten minutes. Are you sure he's not some jealous ex lovers of yours?" Ada ask.

"He's a little scruffy for my taste," Alan says taking a sip of his beverage. "Oh! Shrimp bombs!" He drags his sister to the direction of a waiter holding a platter of fried shrimp wrapped in bacon.
