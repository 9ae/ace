# 9: Invisible kingdom collides with space and time


---

Even though she had always loved parties, Ada struggles to smile at this one. She might throw her beverage at the next girl who ask, "where is Yihan? He normally comes so well dressed." She has been finishing her drink, everytime someone asked that question. And she lost count of how many she had, maybe a few too many. She grip on on the railing of the the grand stairs trying to keep her balance.

"Are you okay?" Alan ask coming up to her. Ada nods, not wanting to worry him. The last thing she needs tonight is her brother taking care of her drunken face. "No, you don't look so good. Let's get some fresh air." Alan drags Ada out of the ballroom, through the cooridors and into the balcony looking over the garden.

Once they are alone, she slides to the ground with tears streaming down her cheeks. Alan pulls a hankerchief from his breast pocket. Ada used it to dry her tears, before looking at it. The hankchief is lavendar with cream white swallows. This was a birthday their parents sent him from Chundu a few years ago, made from the finest Hanon silk. And now it's stained with kohl around her eyes.

Alan sits down next to her, and watches his older sister breathe heavily for a minute. Sometimes she becomes sad drunk, he guess tonight is one of those nights. Their long time friend, who was like a brother to them both, having left just a couple of days ago didn't help their mood tonight. He brings her face to his chest.

She finally speaks, "I pushed him away."

"No, you didn't. How could you have done that, it seems that you two were getting closer lately," he says trying to sound positive.

"Too close. We crossed the line," Ada confessed.

Alan freezes, this explains so many weird instance between his sister and best friend he had been noticing.

"I was afraid to tell you," Ada explains. "I knew you'll get weird about it."

"I... no... I... what exactly.... no never mind, I don't want to know," Alan tries to reassure her. There he was trying to convince her that he won't feel weird about it. And yes, here he is being weird about it.

Ada laughs softly, "see? I knew you would get weird about it." Wrapping her arms around Alan's chest, she says "any way it doesn't matter anymore. He's gone, and it's just us again."

Alan presses his lips against her forehead, "you and me against the world. Forever." They sit like this in silence, they didn't always need words to communicate.

"Aww... now isn't that sweet. The noble Harts having a moment," someone says standing over them. It was the man who kept looking at them when they were talking to Zaki and Vio.
