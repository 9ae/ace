# 9: Invisible kingdom collides with space and time

From the darkness beyond the stage comes an wave of applause. The lights in the miniature theatre turn out revealing Galeian parliament members who rising from their seats. Five of them step forward, the prime minister's advisory board. 

One man picks up prime minister Edgar von Essen's head from the ground, still sparking with electricity. "It's a shame, this may take week's to repair. We'll just have to tell the public von Essen has the flu."

Jacques stood there horrified. They used to be friends, close friends, was that all a lie? "Eh.. eh... Edgar..."

Vio confused by this, and the only one with no personal attachment to Edgar von Essen, speaks her mind. "So Galiean's president is a robot?"

"He hasn't always been one," a woman from the circle of five explains. "Before, he was just an eager to be liked living breathing human. We had him under our control, but in a way you'll control any figurehead ruler."

"A few years he fell in," another says. "If he died, then we'll have to host an re-election and the new prime minister may not be as easy to manipulate. So we brought in the primier cybernetics doctor from the Ice farms. It's very cold there, and people are constantly losing body parts from the cold and malnutrition."

"and their livers from having vodka instead of water," one of them jokes.

Jacques clearly does not think this is funny, "how much of Edgar is still in there!"

The council of five looks at each other, none of them say a word. The woman makes a pained expression and finally says softly, "I'm sorry. But his heart, his brain, it's all gone."

Both Zaki and Jacques drop to their knees in despair, both grieving for every different reasons. Vio turns her head back and forth at both of them, uncertain which one need her support more. Then again, she is never good at comforting people, she always says the wrong things.

 Even though she had always loved parties, Ada struggles to smile at this one. She might throw her beverage at the next girl who ask, "where is Yihan? He normally comes so well dressed." She has been finishing her drink, everytime someone asked that question. And she lost count of how many she had, maybe a few too many. She grip on on the railing of the the grand stairs trying to keep her balance.

"Are you okay?" Alan ask coming up to her. Ada nods, not wanting to worry him. The last thing she needs tonight is her brother taking care of her drunken face. "No, you don't look so good. Let's get some fresh air." Alan drags Ada out of the ballroom, through the cooridors and into the balcony looking over the garden.

Once they are alone, she slides to the ground with tears streaming down her cheeks. Alan pulls a hankerchief from his breast pocket. Ada used it to dry her tears, before looking at it. The hankchief is lavendar with cream white swallows. This was a birthday their parents sent him from Chundu a few years ago, made from the finest Hanon silk. And now it's stained with kohl around her eyes.

Alan sits down next to her, and watches his older sister breathe heavily for a minute. Sometimes she becomes sad drunk, he guess tonight is one of those nights. Their long time friend, who was like a brother to them both, having left just a couple of days ago didn't help their mood tonight. He brings her face to his chest.

She finally speaks, "I pushed him away."

"No, you didn't. How could you have done that, it seems that you two were getting closer lately," he says trying to sound positive.

"Too close. We crossed the line," Ada confessed.

Alan freezes, this explains so many weird instance between his sister and best friend he had been noticing.

"I was afraid to tell you," Ada explains. "I knew you'll get weird about it."

"I... no... I... what exactly.... no never mind, I don't want to know," Alan tries to reassure her. There he was trying to convince her that he won't feel weird about it. And yes, here he is being weird about it.

Ada laughs softly, "see? I knew you would get weird about it." Wrapping her arms around Alan's chest, she says "any way it doesn't matter anymore. He's gone, and it's just us again."

Alan presses his lips against her forehead, "you and me against the world. Forever." They sit like this in silence, they didn't always need words to communicate.

"Aww... now isn't that sweet. The noble Harts having a moment," someone says standing over them. It was the man who kept looking at them when they were talking to Zaki and Vio.

"Vivara Alighieri, who would have though you made it out of that fire alive." One of the councilmen steps up, he had dark hair and a goattie. Nose looked like that of an eagle, in a way no Galeian had. That's because he's not Galeian, he was an Atonian serving in this council. "And mine look at how fine you've grown. It's a shame, you never get to fight your counsin Lesbia for the blood match. You would have won for sure. But I guess, since she's dead you're the defacto heir."

Vio narrows her eyes, trying to figure out who does this stranger know her real name and so much about her family. "How did you know..." then it suddenly hit her. She seen this man before, he attended some of her family's parties. He belonged to a rival city state. But as the tradition of Atonians go, they kept their enemies close. Constantly going to one another's parties, even as they deployed their mercenaries out in the fields. "Giovanni diVitta. What are you doing here?"

"Well, after The Order had taken over our peninsula.  I knew it was no place be, let alone rule. So I high tailed it out, now I'm the foreign affairs advisor. Not bad eh?" he says mockingly.

"How long have you known about me?" Vio ask.

"Us," he corrects. "I've been keeping tabs on your sister and counsin for years. Afterall, when we wipe out The Order, we don't want some girls from the noble bloodlines running back to turn it back into the chaotic mess it was before. Because the High Priest is right about one thing, it's alll the in fighting that allowed Atonia to destroy itself."

"So what? You plan to wipe us out?" Vio says growing more annoyed.

"Welll that was the plan initially, I even hired the city's best poison maker to get rid of you girls," he motions to Zaki, who looks up ashamed. "But he only manage to kill one. He was suppose to get you, but then a few months ago. He gave up on me! 'I quit!' he said, then dropped off the advanced I had given him for killing your cousin." He minicks Zaki walking off in his large trench coat.

Vio looks at Zaki, the murderer of her cousin had shared meals with them. She had kissed him, those same lips used to poison her cousin. She can feel her consciousness slipping away, the moon taking away her reasoning, and fire rising from her feet. She turns to "Jacques, if this is what you wanted to see. Well here you have it!"

Jacques watch the irises of her eyes disappear and her eyes turn into orbs of glass. The mystery of her powers had always intrigued him, but demonstration of her powers in action frighten him. Zaki stood up, "if you don't want to take any chances with your life tonight, now is the time to leave." Without hesitation Jacques sprints out of the theatre. Zaki on the other hand picks up his blade, and places his back against Vio. He's not sure if she is still in there, or her body is just a shell to enact celestial powers. But he wants to be on the prior, "I'm here for you." She presses her back close to his as if acknowledging his words, before thrusting one of her daggers into the eye of the Atonian councilmen.

"It's you," Ada says suddenly standing up. "Why were you watching us?!"

"Well I was rather offended. You came to *my* prison, but didn't bother to stop by the warren's office to say hello," he says with his hands over his chest indicating hurt. They were naive to think their attempted break in will go unnoticed. "I understand you guys are pretty high up in the security department. But next time you decide that one of my inmates is wrongful held, I want you to talk to me first." He looks at Alan who also stood up now.

"How," Alan says.

"Oh, Sam told me everything," the warren says with a smile as wide as his arms sweeping when he said the word 'everything'. "He told me how you tried to convince him to leave with you."

"He was leaving with me," Alan says.

"Until you guys abandoned him with the guard," the warren clarifies. Alan bites his lip, they shouldn't have left without Sam or the guard who caught them alive. He also couldn't believe Sam had betrayed him by telling the warren, but he guess the warren was right they did leave him. After all he had know Alan for less than twenty minutes, what loyalty did he owe him.

Ada speaks up, "Sure we broke in. But what you are doing to the inmates! That should be illegal! It's inhumane. Just we you wait, we'll tell parliment. They won't let you continue to run Ryker's Facility."

"Oh, parliament knows", the warren laughs, "just exactly how I've been running Rykers. In fact they requested it, to try some new treatments on these hopeless scum."

"Then we'll tell the public!" Ada spits back.

The warren shakes his held slowly, "I'm afraid you won't get the chance." Four armed men appear behind him, fully suited, assault rifles loaded.

Alan takes his sister's hand, neither of them were fighters. They were mathematicans, so they did the only sane action a mathematician will do in this scenario. They run!

Luckily for the owners of this mansion, the seats in this theatre are deep scarlet. They can just claim the bloodstains were always there, just a natural part of the upholstery's pattern. Vio picks up one dagger from the floor, and talks over to a body and removes the other lodged into a man's chest.

Zaki takes a step back towards the curtains. This was not the first time, he had seen her attack a room full of people. But this time was different, when they were trapped in the church with Edgar's special force squad, she fought them off. That was a fair fight, they would have done the same to her. But this time it is different, these are middle aged politicans, not trained killers. This was a slaughter. He repolish the tip of his blade with the last drops of poison, before she turns to him. The glassy glaze from her eyes are gone, her irises reappeared. She is no longer in a trance, but the Vio who approaches him does not look like she is done with killing for the night either.

With both daggers pointed to the ground, still dripping of blood, she speaks. "You killed Lessa. And you were going to do the same with Sicili, aren't you?!"

"Well, initially yes, that was the assignment," he says as he steps backwards. "But I fell in love. Look, I gave the guy who hired me his money back. Even the money I earned for your cousin."

As if she hadn't heard him or whatever he says no longer matters, she repeats. "You killed my cousin. She was Sicili's guardian. She worked her body off to keep her safe. If you really love Sicili, how could you?!"

"I didn't know Sicili then," Zaki explains "and after meeting you two. I feel terribly guilty for what, I've done. I truly am sorry."

"Sorry won't bring her back!" she says as she slices through the air. "Edgar said he was sorry, did that matter to you?"

"No, but you are someone who forgives regardless of someone has done" Zaki tries to remind her.

"The woman who believes in forgiveness is gone," she says taking another slice his direction. She wasn't intending to kill him just yet, he can tell she is still toying with him. Because the moment she intends to make killing blows, he won't have time to reflect on her intentions. He steps towards a dark corner hoping for more cover. 

"It was just a job," says Zaki. "You said so yourself before, no one needs to die because of their job."

"It was just my cousin, who died because you were doing your job," she sweeps her dagger so close this time he had to perrying it with his own. Zaki knows he's running out of time for talking. But then a doors opens flooding in light from the hallway into the dim theatre.

"Vio! Zaki!" Sicili calls from the entrance. "What are you guys doing?! The coach is here, we have to go!"

"Oh, he won't be coming with us," Vio says. "He die right here!"

Sicili runs inbetween them, "what do you mean?!"

"You know how we spent years trying to find Lessa's killer?" Vio says addressing her sister, with her head tilted to the side in a mock curious expression. "He's been in front of us all along."

Sicili looks at Zaki, "no" she mutters.

"Yes," he says. "But I didn't mean to. I can explain..."

"Explain later," Sicili says not looking at him in the eye. "No matter what he's done, killing him won't bring Lessa back. Nor will it bring you peace about never getting to fight her when you grow up." Talking up to her sister she puts her hand on her forearm holding her daggers. Looking up at Vio in the eye, she says "Lady Lygeia would listen to him, even if he murdered her children."

"I wish he had," Vio spits. She breathes deeply, Sicili is right she knows it. "Let's go." The three of them leave the blood stained theatre.

Sicili guides them through to unoccupied halls since at their current state of dress Vio and Zaki will not be able to mask as casual ball attendees no longer. Right when they are home free, the come colliding with the Harts running fast, and behind them gun shots.

"Come with us," Vio calls grabbing Ada's hand. Alan stops to knock over a stone bust hoping it will stop their pursuers. He fell several paces behind them, but knowing he can sprint fast, it didn't matter until a bullet flew threw his chest. Blood marks the place of his heart on his cream suit.

"Nooooo!!!!" Ada screams running towards her brother. But Vio holds her back, the redhead was surprisingly strong. They were not going to make it to their escape carrage safely with four snipers after them. She gives Ada to Sicili as she and Zaki goes to fight them. The snipers were much less trained in melee.

"Let me go," Ada struggles with Sicili.

"It's too late," Sicili says. "There's nothing you can do." Ada wails into Sicili's dress.

Zaki returns to Sicili after they fend off the snipers, "which way?"

Sicili pulls Ada up and the four of them run towards the stable, where Yule is waiting for them in the dark with a carriage.
