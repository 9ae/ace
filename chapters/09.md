# 9: Invisible kingdom collides with space and time


---

Even though she had always loved parties, Ada struggles to smile at this one. She might throw her beverage at the next girl who ask, "where is Yihan? He normally comes so well dressed." She has been finishing her drink, everytime someone asked that question. And she lost count of how many she had, maybe a few too many. She grip on on the railing of the the grand stairs trying to keep her balance.

"Are you okay?" Alan ask coming up to her. Ada nods, not wanting to worry him. The last thing she needs tonight is her brother taking care of her drunken face. "No, you don't look so good. Let's get some fresh air." Alan drags Ada out of the ballroom, through the cooridors and into the balcony looking over the garden.

Once they are alone, she slides to the ground with tears streaming down her cheeks. Alan pulls a hankerchief from his breast pocket. Ada used it to dry her tears, before looking at it. The hankchief is lavendar with cream white swallows. This was a birthday their parents sent him from Chundu a few years ago, made from the finest Hanon silk. And now it's stained with kohl around her eyes.

Alan sits down next to her, and watches his older sister breathe heavily for a minute. Sometimes she becomes sad drunk, he guess tonight is one of those nights. Their long time friend, who was like a brother to them both, having left just a couple of days ago didn't help their mood tonight. He brings her face to his chest.

She finally speaks, "I pushed him away."

"No, you didn't. How could you have done that, it seems that you two were getting closer lately," he says trying to sound positive.

"Too close. We crossed the line," Ada confessed.

Alan freezes, this explains so many weird instance between his sister and best friend he had been noticing.

"I was afraid to tell you," Ada explains. "I knew you'll get weird about it."

"I... no... I... what exactly.... no never mind, I don't want to know," Alan tries to reassure her. There he was trying to convince her that he won't feel weird about it. And yes, here he is being weird about it.

Ada laughs softly, "see? I knew you would get weird about it." Wrapping her arms around Alan's chest, she says "any way it doesn't matter anymore. He's gone, and it's just us again."

Alan presses his lips against her forehead, "you and me against the world. Forever." They sit like this in silence, they didn't always need words to communicate.

"Aww... now isn't that sweet. The noble Harts having a moment," someone says standing over them. It was the man who kept looking at them when they were talking to Zaki and Vio.

"It's you," Ada says suddenly standing up. "Why were you watching us?!"

"Well I was rather offended. You came to *my* prison, but didn't bother to stop by the warren's office to say hello," he says with his hands over his chest indicating hurt. They were naive to think their attempted break in will go unnoticed. "I understand you guys are pretty high up in the security department. But next time you decide that one of my inmates is wrongful held, I want you to talk to me first." He looks at Alan who also stood up now.

"How," Alan says.

"Oh, Sam told me everything," the warren says with a smile as wide as his arms sweeping when he said the word 'everything'. "He told me how you tried to convince him to leave with you."

"He was leaving with me," Alan says.

"Until you guys abandoned him with the guard," the warren clarifies. Alan bites his lip, they shouldn't have left without Sam or the guard who caught them alive. He also couldn't believe Sam had betrayed him by telling the warren, but he guess the warren was right they did leave him. After all he had know Alan for less than twenty minutes, what loyalty did he owe him.

Ada speaks up, "Sure we broke in. But what you are doing to the inmates! That should be illegal! It's inhumane. Just we you wait, we'll tell parliment. They won't let you continue to run Ryker's Facility."

"Oh, parliament knows", the warren laughs, "just exactly how I've been running Rykers. In fact they requested it, to try some new treatments on these hopeless scum."

"Then we'll tell the public!" Ada spits back.

The warren shakes his held slowly, "I'm afraid you won't get the chance." Four armed men appear behind him, fully suited, assault rifles loaded.

Alan takes his sister's hand, neither of them were fighters. They were mathematicans, so they did the only sane action a mathematician will do in this scenario. They run!

Luckily for the owners of this mansion, the seats in this theatre are deep scarlet. They can just claim the bloodstains were always there, just a natural part of the upholstery's pattern. Vio picks up one dagger from the floor, and talks over to a body and removes the other lodged into a man's chest.

Zaki takes a step back towards the curtains. This was not the first time, he had seen her attack a room full of people. But this time was different, when they were trapped in the church with Edgar's special force squad, she fought them off. That was a fair fight, they would have done the same to her. But this time it is different, these are middle aged politicans, not trained killers. This was a slaughter. He repolish the tip of his blade with the last drops of poison, before she turns to him. The glassy glaze from her eyes are gone, her irises reappeared. She is no longer in a trance, but the Vio who approaches him does not look like she is done with killing for the night either.

With both daggers pointed to the ground, still dripping of blood, she speaks. "You killed Lessa. And you were going to do the same with Sicili, aren't you?!"

"Well, initially yes, that was the assignment," he says as he steps backwards. "But I fell in love. Look, I gave the guy who hired me his money back. Even the money I earned for your cousin."

As if she hadn't heard him or whatever he says no longer matters, she repeats. "You killed my cousin. She was Sicili's guardian. She worked her body off to keep her safe. If you really love Sicili, how could you?!"

"I didn't know Sicili then," Zaki explains "and after meeting you two. I feel terribly guilty for what, I've done. I truly am sorry."

"Sorry won't bring her back!" she says as she slices through the air. "Edgar said he was sorry, did that matter to you?"

"No, but you are someone who forgives regardless of someone has done" Zaki tries to remind her.

"The woman who believes in forgiveness is gone," she says taking another slice his direction. She wasn't intending to kill him just yet, he can tell she is still toying with him. Because the moment she intends to make killing blows, he won't have time to reflect on her intentions. He steps towards a dark corner hoping for more cover. 

"It was just a job," says Zaki. "You said so yourself before, no one needs to die because of their job."

"It was just my cousin, who died because you were doing your job," she sweeps her dagger so close this time he had to perrying it with his own. Zaki knows he's running out of time for talking. But then a doors opens flooding in light from the hallway into the dim theatre.

"Vio! Zaki!" Sicili calls from the entrance. "What are you guys doing?! The coach is here, we have to go!"

"Oh, he won't be coming with us," Vio says. "He die right here!"

Sicili runs inbetween them, "what do you mean?!"

"You know how we spent years trying to find Lessa's killer?" Vio says addressing her sister, with her head tilted to the side in a mock curious expression. "He's been in front of us all along."

Sicili looks at Zaki, "no" she mutters.

"Yes," he says. "But I didn't mean to. I can explain..."

"Explain later," Sicili says not looking at him in the eye. "No matter what he's done, killing him won't bring Lessa back. Nor will it bring you peace about never getting to fight her when you grow up." Talking up to her sister she puts her hand on her forearm holding her daggers. Looking up at Vio in the eye, she says "Lady Lygeia would listen to him, even if he murdered her children."

"I wish he had," Vio spits. She breathes deeply, Sicili is right she knows it. "Let's go." The three of them leave the blood stained theatre.
