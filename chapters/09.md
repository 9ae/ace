The sun streams its rays through the window of a empty room. Ada can't recall when was the last time the sun had shined here, since Yihan always had his curtains down. Last night when Vio and Yule finally rejoined them at the car, it was late. So Yule offered everyone a place to say in the guest suites of the cathedral. By the time Alan and Ada returned to their flat this morning Yihan and all his belongings are gone.

She steps inside, feeling the sunlight through the glass burn on her skin. The room still smells of the body freshener he uses, cloves and cucumber. She walks towards the curtains and wraps them around her arms as she sinks down to the ground.

Ada stays in Yihan's room like this for a while, she isn't sure how long. Maybe twenty minutes, maybe a few hours. She runs through her memories for the moments they've shared together over the pass four years. In and out of faking, she drifts... if only she can bottle all these moments into her dreams. The loud buzz of a doorbell breaks her out of reverie.

At the door, she finds her brother's boyfriend. "Good morning!" he greets her cheerfully. She backs away from the door, letting Adolf steps in.

"Are you feeling ill?" Adolf ask.

"No. Do I look ill?" says Ada.

"You look...", Adolf says. '*vacant? Like you a trying to hold yourself together by loose threads.*' "You look a bit spaced out."

y"Oh, we just had a long night," she answers. "Alan in this room, by the way."

Adolf takes this as a cue that she no longer wants to talk about what's troubling her, and went to the bedroom. Alan had been hitting a punching bag dangling from the ceiling when Adolf comes in. His undershirt clung to his chest glossy with sweat. It look Adolf some restraint to not tackle Alan to his bed. And it took Alan several throws to notice someone had come in. "Oh! Sorry I didn't hear you come in."

"Man, what's with you two today. Your sister seems rather distracted when she answer the door. Is Yihan in the clouds too?" ask Adolf.

Alan replies by holding onto a long silence. Taking off his gloves he hits the punching bag one last time with his bare fist.

"Oh god! Is he alright? Is that why you two are," Adolf says.

"He's alive... and I think safe," Alan explains. "He left us last night."

"What do you mean left?" Adolf ask. And Alan tells in everything. How they tried to rescue Sicili, how at the end of their mission, Yihan announces that he will be servering connection with the Harts. When he finally finished, Adolf had very little to say... "oh man. What a night. But I feel there's something missing..."

"Maybe. But he made his choice, and I so I'm going to respect that," says Alan. "Oh to happier things. Are you working the upcoming Saturday?"

"No, why? Do you have something special in mind?" Adolf whispers into Alan's neck/

Alan chuckles in a low tone he rarely uses. "Well, there's this ball. I think a governor is going to announce someone their family is adopting or something. And I would like you to be my date?"

"It's a ball, and public officials will be there?" ask Adolf.

"Yes, a very public event. If you don't mind? It will be nice for us to be seen our in public for once," says Alan.

"Then a lot of people who are my clients and their family will be there," Adolf explains. "People will talk about the company you keep."

"I don't care," says Alan, pushing a few strands of hair from Adolf's forehead. "I want the whole world to know, but firstly I want you to know. I love you."

Adolf didn't know what to say, it's the only time anyone has said those words to him outside the throws of passion. He kisses Alan, who presses back. When they finally parted lips, Adolf takes this chance to pull hair from Alan's face, "I love you too." They kiss again, this time longer. For hours they wrap themselves in the other person.

By the time they are taking again, the sun is setting. Adolf starts, "I'm still not sure, if I'll be ready to come as your date."

"Ok, I guess.. you're not ready," Alan stumbles with his words a little disappointed and uncertain.

"But I do want us to be seen in public together," Adolf reassures him. "Maybe we can start with something public, but not in a room with public figures?"

"Adolf _, would you like to go to the New Year's Philoharmonic with me?" Alan ask an offical sounding voice to tease him

"Alan Hart, Lord of Wickshire, there nowhere I'd rather be than at the orchestra with you," giggles Adolf, laying another kiss on the sweetest man in the world.

Yule had been staying with Vio since they got back from their failed mission. He didn't trust his adoptive little sister to not do something irrational in the search of her actual younger sister. This is a rare evening in which Vio didn't have to go to work tonight, so they can eat dinner at a leisurely pace. The television is tuned in to the evening news, as he tries to make conversation while she twirls her spaghetti around her fork.

"Are you trying to make yarn balls with those?" Yule ask jokingly. No reply. He gets back to eating his own food. With Sicili gone, there's no cook in the house, and their takeout containers are piled high.

The TV anchor talks about one of the governors who doesn't have children is adopting a sixteen year old into her family. The footage shows a picture of a woman and her wife, with a brunette girl waving at the crew of reporters. "What is notable is the girl before was an illegal resident, performing terrorist acts for The Order. By adopting her, she can now become a legal citizen of Galei and stay here leading a normal life. They are saying to the people of Galei, we can help you in ways The High Priest never can. Miss, how do you feel about their extension of kindness?"

"I am ever so grateful that Nadine and Sakina have decided to take me in," she says softly.

Vio suddenly looks up, because she recognized the voice. And right before her eyes, staring at her in black and white and grainly dots is her very own sister. About to become a member of another family. Maybe this is for the best, Sicili will live a happier live under the care. Their entire mission into Ryker's facility had been a waste of time, and she cost the Harts their long time friend.

The her doorbell jingles, she turns her head towards it but makes no motion to stand up. "I'll get it," Yule announces. Yule opens the door to Zaki standing there, gone is his usual trench coat, instead he wore a black turtleneck sweater and brown slacks. "Sorry, we aren't talking to traitors today," Yule is about to close the door on his face.

"Wait, it's about Sicili!" Zaki calls out holding his hand on the door. "I think she is..."

"Being adopted by a governor?" Yule says sarcastically. "Yea, we know." He opens the door wider to reveal they are watching the broadcast.

Zaki takes this opportunity to step in, completely ignoring Yule he address Vio. "I can get you a chance to talk to her. But I will also neeed your help."

Vio looks at him for a few seconds, and finally stands up leveling herself to his eye level, replies "what do you have in mind?"
