"They make kids go to school on Saturdays?" Vio ask Sicili as she was preparing to leave one morning. 

"No, but you know I volunteer at church today." says Sicili.

"With the bombings, and hostile relationships with the police and the Order. I think it best if you take a break from volunteer duty for a while," suggest her sister.

"With all that is going on, I think it's more critical that I go in," rebutes Sicli. "Several members called in sick already, probably also afraid to go to church because of the bombings. They need my help. I understands the risk," Sicili continues. "If something happens, I'll..."

"Put the safety of others before hers." Vio finishes. "You doesn't know how to look out for herself. My sister has a martyr complex!"

"I can too look out for myself!" Sicili exlaims. "I had survived all those years without you. Lessa and I were fine without you." She storms out of the front door closing it loudly.

Vio buries her face in her arms to hide the tears swelling up, and mumbles "but I wouldn't be without you."

Zaki, who just got out of the shower had watched the tail end of their fight. He reaches out to stroke her back, and she begings to sob. It's the first time he's seen her cry. "Shh... she'll be fine."

"I'm suppose to protect her," Vio chokes out.

"And you've been doing a really good job," he assures her.

"It's been my entire purpose, behind every decision, to keep Sicili safe. But how can I do that when she's running into danger?" ask Vio.

"I don't have siblings. But maybe the point is not to keep her from danger, but prepare her to face the danger she'll have to one day face alone." asys Zaki. He wasn't sure if that was what being a sibling was about, but it had been what his father had told him being a parent was suppose to be about, when he saw parents at Galei being over protective of their children.

"If that's the case, I'm doing a crap job still. She could barely take down one attacker. Sicili was never a fighter, she never had it in her heart to go in for the kill."

"And that's such a bad thing?" ask Zaki.

"If you are always too afraid to hurt, then you are always fighting with one hand tied behind your back." says Vio.

"I suppose, that's true. Maybe her strength isn't in her physical abilites, but she can get by because she inspires other to fight for her." Zaki reflects.

Vio chuckles, having calm down. "That she is good at. Did I ever tell you when we were little..."

When Sicili arrived to the church, she finds its front gates closed. The pastor wore jean overalls and a faded white shirt, trimming lemon trees in the garden. "Pastor Thomas!" she calls out. 

He looks over and she waves as he walks over. "Sister Sicili! Didn't expect to see you today."

"But isn't it my turn to conduct the youth fellowship today?" says Sicili.

"Oh, you didn't get hear. The mayor has put a mandate to close all the churches in Ixan," he explains.

"What? they can't do that! The state has no right over any religious institutions!" she exclaims. She is uncharacteristically angry this morning. Her fight with Vio left her with an unsettled stomach.

The pastor sighs, "they sure can if they proclaim national security emergency."

"It's so strange to think Galei has become such a lawless place, with no checks and measures for ensuring people's rights." she says.

"You know, the new cathedral is still opened. The police couldn't shut that down with the High Priest's militia posting gaurd there. Maybe you can see if they could use some help, other than their guards, I heard they are barely staffed for other services."

The pastor's son comes up to the gate, and greets Sicili with a shy smile, and turns to his the pastor. "Father, he wants to ask you about the auction." Sicili wonder who else is in the church if it as suppose to be close. To her knowledge Pastor Thomas only lived with his son, in the cabin next to the church.

"You know what? I think I will go to the cathedral to see if they have anything I can do. It's nice seeing you Pastor Thomas and James."

"Even though we are closed, don't hestitate to stop by. I found a new way to make blueberry pie, you must try some next time," says James.

Sicili turns to leave, but instead of heading to the cathedral she turns the corner into the church's side entrance. Luckily, the gates there were still unlocked. She walks through the pantry and hears talking coming from the pastor's office.

"So you are saying you don't know who won the bid for that painting?!" says a voice that belonged neither to the pastor nor his son.

Sicili finds a spot behind a bag of flour, giving her view into the office window. They were talking to a tall man with ginger hair and beard. He was unmistably the High Priest Roderick! 

"She was a nun from the church in Vanir, I think she registered under their address," the pastor explains. "Hold on let me find the record."

"Did she leave a name? What did she look like?" ask Roderick.

"No, she was just number 83," Pastor Thomas answers as he runs his fingers across a row in a large set of binded paper.

"She was middle aged, and from what I could make out creeping under her veil, she has bright hair like yours." James chimes in. "A color like that is not common around these parts, hard to forget."

"Here," the pastor hands Roderick a piece of paper, he copied into. "That's the address she registered her number under. It's likely, they are hanging the painting you are looking for. 'Prophet Rising' a rare find."

"That is if it isn't a forgery," says James. "I heard it was a pretty popular piece circling the black markets a few years back. Only that several cities said they had it, which would not be possible unless some of them were fake."

"Leave that to me to investigate," says Roderick. "Thank you for your help pastor, I'll make sure the main branch allocates plenty of funds to your church next year."

Pastor Thomas rolls, his eyes as the High Priest turns to leave. "No problem, glad to be of service."

'*Why was the High Priest so intersted in this painting,*' Sicili wonders as she silently sneaks through the sidedoor back out.

The train was already fifteen minutes late. "Remember, when Galei was known for its trains always being ontime." asked Zaki. The other two were silent. 

"In the two years, I've been here. They've never been on time," says Vio.

"Yea, isn't that just a myth they say to get people to immigrate over?" ask Yule.

"No, they were on time when I was a kid," reflects Zaki.
