"Aren't you off today?" Vio ask Sicili on Sunday morning. 

"From school? Yea. But you know I volunteer at church." says Sicili.

"With the bombings, and hostile relationships with the police and the Order. I think it best if you take a break from volunteer duty for a while," suggest her sister.

"With all that is going on, I think it's more critical that I go in," rebutes Sicli. "Several volunteers called in sick already, probably also afraid to go to church because of the bombings. They need my help."

"I understands the risk," Sicili continues. "If something happens, I'll..."

"Put the safety of others before hers." Vio finishes. "She doesn't know how to look out for herself. My sister has a martyr complex!"

"I can too look out for myself!" Sicili exlaims. "I had survived all those years without you. Lessa and I were fine without you." She storms out of the front door closing it loudly.

Vio buries her face in her arms to hide the tears swelling up, and mumbles "but I wouldn't be without you."

> Zaki comes out of the shower.... revise following scene

Zaki reaches out to stroke her back, and she begings to sob. It's the first time he's seen her cry. "Shh... she'll be fine."

"I'm suppose to protect her," Vio chokes out.

"And you've been doing a really good job," he assures her.

"It's been my entire purpose, behind every decision, to keep Sicili safe. But how can I do that when she's running into danger?" ask Vio.

"I don't have siblings. But maybe the point is not to keep her from danger, but prepare her to face the danger she'll have to one day face alone." asys Zaki.

"If that's the case, I'm doing a crap job still. She could barely take down one attacker. Sicili was never a fighter, she never had it in her heart to go in for the kill."

"And that's such a bad thing?" ask Zaki.

"If you are always too afraid to hurt, then you are always fighting with one hand tied behind your back." says Vio.

"I suppose, that's true. Maybe her strength isn't in her physical abilites, but she can get by because she inspires other to fight for her." Zaki reflects.

Vio chuckles, having calm down. "That she is good at. Did I ever tell you when we were little..."

The train was already fifteen minutes late. "Remember, when Galei was known for its trains always being ontime." asked Zaki. The other two were silent. 

"In the two years, I've been here. They've never been on time," says Vio.

"Yea, isn't that just a myth they say to get people to immigrate over?" ask Yule.

"No, they were on time when I was a kid," reflects Zaki.
