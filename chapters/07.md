By the time Yule's train pulled up to Ixan Union Station, the sky had gone completely dark. Even though he was only at this station this morning, it feels as if years had gone by. He hails a carrage to take him back to the cathedral. Even though today is coming to an end, he knows Roderick will awake and wating for him; waiting for an explanation on why he disobeyed the orders to escape when he had a the chance. In the _ years that he had been part of the crusade, Yule had never disobeyed an order. But he knew how Roderick handled disobedience. Solders were immediately discharged; anyone higher up was executed in front of their subodinates, and the entire camp. Yule hopes that bringing back the long lost painting will afford him some forgiveness. He is Roderick's right hand man. He knew too much to be simply discharged.
