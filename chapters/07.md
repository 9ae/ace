By the time Yule's train pulled up to Ixan Union Station, the sky had gone completely dark. Even though he was only at this station this morning, it feels as if years had gone by. He hails a carrage to take him back to the cathedral. Even though today is coming to an end, he knows Roderick will awake and wating for him; waiting for an explanation on why he disobeyed the orders to escape when he had a the chance. 

Yule runs over what to say in his mind. What he had done, he did not regret. Leading the workers in the church to safety is what The Prophet Lygeia would have done. Even if he was starting to question The Order under The High Priest leadership, he still believes in living by the Prophet's words. But how do you politely tell someone you chose to follow the will of their dead mother instead of their present command?

In the _ years that he had been part of the crusade, Yule had never disobeyed an order. But he knew how Roderick handled disobedience. Solders were immediately discharged; anyone higher up was executed in front of their subodinates, and the entire camp. Yule hopes that bringing back the long lost painting will afford him some forgiveness. He is Roderick's right hand man. He knew too much to be simply discharged.

When the carriage pulls up to the cathedral, Yule's is so nervous that he almost forgets to take the painting with him as he got off. Outside lighting was finally installed earlier last week, they shined up from corners and edges, giving the whole structure an ominous glow. A few of The Order's soldiers standing guard salute to him, as others open the gates for him. The grand hall was quiet at night, all who were not on guard duty are already asleep. And as expected Roderick was in his office, his head buried under rolls of scrolls.

"High Priest, I've returned with The Prophet Rising" Yule says addressing Roderick in a more formal title than he had been using in years. Roderick nods, but does not look up from his paperwork. His superior's silence made Yule nervous, so he continues talking. "I'm sorry this assignment took so long, we had a run in with Galeian special task force and the local police. I know Varin's church had refused to ally with us before, but I had helped them a great deal. And hopefully if you ask them again, the Priest there may reconsider and support our cause."

Roderick inally looks up, "It seems Varin has enough struggles of their own, their church's alliigence now will only become a liability for us to care for instead of a strategic advantage as it once had been."

Yule swallows, while he is not shocked by The High Priest's calculating choices, how much they stray from the core tenants of their very own religion is difficult to reason with. 

"Was that what you were trying to do?" The High Priest continues. "Gain their support by ignoring my orders?"

"I wasn't trying to defy you," Yule reasons. "But I couldn't leave them there, your mother wouldn't have."

"My mother, her holiness, was a fool!" Roderick says. "She never saw the bigger picture. And thus, she never reached fair with her teachings. Both she and my sister were too caught up in the leaves to see the forest."

The bigger picture, that was why Yule was here wasn't he? The joined the Order because he knew that scarfices must be made for the great good; for long lasting peace, there may be slaughter to pay. "Sorry, I lost sight of our mission."

Roderick gets up from behind the desk and walks up to him, "Commander Yule, the name you hold I gave you. The Order saved you from the mountain savages. We clothed you, thought you the ways of civilized men. We taught you strategy, planning, and diplomancy. Yet beneath it all," Roderick's hands stray down to Yule's chest. "I wonder, does there still lie the heart of a savage? Ready to act according to the moment. Failing to see the bigger picture?" He removes his hand from Yule's chest and gestures at the murals around the room detailing The Order's glory and Lady Lygeia's missions.

Yule didn't know what to say, especially when the high priest accused him of the one thing he try to outgrow. "I...I..."

"You?" Roderick asks impatiently.

"I brought you back the missing masterpiece!" Yule lifts the canvas up, it's presence will make Roderick re-evaluate his performance on this mission.

Roderick tears the brown paper that wraps the painting. His hands trace along the bevel of the oil strokes. Fingers feeling the texture of the bed that his recently deceased mother rose from that faithful night. In a soft voice he mutters, "yes, you have. Good job." And in one quick swing, tosses the canvas into the active fire place. Flames tore through the middle, and the room started to smell of burning old chemicals.

"What?!" Yule reacts. "Is it a fake? I brought a forger along with me to validate it's authenticity."

"No, it looked real enough," says Roderick. "As I told you, it's all about the bigger picture. This painting was never that picture."

"Then why?" ask Yule. 

"I don't think that is something you need to know, General." Roderick says demoting Yule and dismissing him for the night.
