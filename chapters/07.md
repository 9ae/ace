By the time Yule's train pulled up to Ixan Union Station, the sky had gone completely dark. Even though he was only at this station this morning, it feels as if years had gone by. He hails a carrage to take him back to the cathedral. Even though today is coming to an end, he knows Roderick will awake and wating for him; waiting for an explanation on why he disobeyed the orders to escape when he had a the chance. 

Yule runs over what to say in his mind. What he had done, he did not regret. Leading the workers in the church to safety is what The Prophet Lygeia would have done. Even if he was starting to question The Order under The High Priest leadership, he still believes in living by the Prophet's words. But how do you politely tell someone you chose to follow the will of their dead mother instead of their present command?

In the _ years that he had been part of the crusade, Yule had never disobeyed an order. But he knew how Roderick handled disobedience. Solders were immediately discharged; anyone higher up was executed in front of their subodinates, and the entire camp. Yule hopes that bringing back the long lost painting will afford him some forgiveness. He is Roderick's right hand man. He knew too much to be simply discharged.

When the carriage pulls up to the cathedral, Yule's is so nervous that he almost forgets to take the painting with him as he got off. Outside lighting was finally installed earlier last week, they shined up from corners and edges, giving the whole structure an ominous glow. A few of The Order's soldiers standing guard salute to him, as others open the gates for him. The grand hall was quiet at night, all who were not on guard duty are already asleep. And as expected Roderick was in his office, his head buried under rolls of scrolls.

"High Priest, I've turned with The Prophet Rising" Yule says addressing Roderick in a more formal title than he had been using in years. Roderick nods, but does not look up from his paperwork. His superior's silence made Yule nervous, so he continues talking. "I'm sorry this assignment took so long, we had a run in with Galeian special task force and the local police. I know Varin's church had refused to ally with us before, but I had helped them a great deal. And hopefully if you ask them again, the Priest there may reconsider and support our cause."

Roderick inally looks up, "It seems Varin has enough struggles of their own, their church's alliigence now will only become a liability for us to care for instead of a strategic advantage as it once had been."

Yule swallows, while he is not shocked by The High Priest's calculating choices, how much they stray from the core tenants of their very own religion is difficult to reason with.
