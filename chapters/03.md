It has been years since Vivara had seen another human being. Since she's been separated from her sister and cousin the night she lived in a cave in the forest alone. She would have never guessed the snare skills uncle _ had taught her became her lifeline for surviving. In these mountains paths are narrow, and inclines steep. Traveler prefer to take the valleys. Vivara peered at the rather lengthy procession of travelers through the evergreens. Renzo, a wild dog she had befriend sometime back started to growl. Renzo and Eleonora, a her hunting raven has been the only living creatures she kept company. Ever since she was a child, she had always found comfort in the company of animals. Her family kept guard dogs of course. She and Sicili would sneak out during her parent's parties, when Vivara got overwhelmed by the guest to play with them. Then the night when her family's estate got raided, all thirteen of the hounds were found near the stables, each baring multiple gunshot wounds, all dead. In all the eleven years of her life, they had been her only true friends. She loved Sicili, but she was always something Vivara had to protect. But with her dogs, they were different, their connection was mutual. She felt that they had understood eachother in ways that were beyond the boundaries of what words can be described. Sicili had always been a lady of words, she always knew how to phrase her feelings eloquently. Despite what Lesbia saids about Vivara being robotic, Vivara had always felt too much. But her feelings can't be encapulsated in words, or any other forms of expression understandable by other humans, thus she was prone to random fits of tears, and bouts of rage.

 Vivara calculated her odds, if she was to raid this traveling group. It was a congression of twenty people, they appeared to be a large family, with mostly children and the adults at the front and back, like a flock of geese crossing the roads. They did not appear to be heavily armed; and the last two carriages had cargo. Two men had a large boar skewered staff.  She figured if she was to attach she should jump down when the carriage approaches, if she lands on top of it she can have the upperhand. She motioned Renzo to hold off, as she mounted an arrow to her handmade bow.

 Arrow flies down, the driver from the 3rd carriage looks back. Vivara jumps but instead of landing on the carriage she tumbles off its edge falls to the edge. "Halt!" a voice from the carriage she collided with calls. The entire congression stops.

 > (TODO write attack scene) Actually she should put up a good fight scene, and ends up squaring off with a boy her age, Erik.

The boy (Erik) held the tip of his sword to her neck. Regret and shame overcame Vivara, she can't believe she had been so stupid to attempt to attack this party. She hadn't fought with humans in years. Her biggest opponent had be mountain lions and jackals, and they've long ago stop being a challenge for her. What did her uncle say? The moment you can win on a consistent basis, is the moment you will lose sooner or later.

 The older boy (Yule) asked, "Is the rest of your crew coming to back you up?"

 It took Vivara a long moment to realize he was addressing her. Had she forgotten how to talk? She shook her head. Ace: Alone.
Yule: Laconic, you'll fit in well with us. You must be hungry, com'on violence is never the answer, blood only begets blood.

She nodded and finally blurted "yes, I am" in a mechanical atonal mumble, even though he had not asked her a question.

Yule: Jyri is dead, I am reborn. I am Yule.
Ace: Traitor!
*Ace brings her knife to his throat, but it collides with his sheild instead. They continue to fight…

*Yule launches his spear at her, Ace dodges*
Ace: Whatever happened to violence is not the answer?
Yule: Sometimes it is necessary for peace.
Ace: “Blood begets blood”
Yule: You see how this new government will oppress and enslave so many. We the Church must save them.
Ace: By displacing people from their homes and mass murder?
Yule: Don’t be so high and mighty. You killed to survive, you would have murdered my tribemen's for our food. And we took you in!
Ace: And when the crusades came to our tribe, you blowed down, you let your own parents be burnt. And your younger brother….  Erik is gone because of you.
*Ace starts to tear up.* 

*Someone puts a hand on her shoulder. It turns out to be Jacque.*
Jacque: You do not bear weapons of our organization against our allies.
