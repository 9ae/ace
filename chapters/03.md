It has been years since Vivara had seen another human being. Since she's been separated from her sister and cousin the night she lived in a cave in the forest alone. She would have never guessed the snare skills uncle _ had taught her became her lifeline for surviving. In these mountains paths are narrow, and inclines steep. Traveler prefer to take the valleys. Vivara peered at the rather lengthy procession of travelers through the evergreens. Renzo, a wild dog she had befriend sometime back started to growl. Renzo and Eleonora, a her hunting raven has been the only living creatures she kept company. Ever since she was a child, she had always found comfort in the company of animals. Her family kept guard dogs of course. She and Sicili would sneak out during her parent's parties, when Vivara got overwhelmed by the guest to play with them. Then the night when her family's estate got raided, all thirteen of the hounds were found near the stables, each baring multiple gunshot wounds, all dead. In all the eleven years of her life, they had been her only true friends. She loved Sicili, but she was always something Vivara had to protect. But with her dogs, they were different, their connection was mutual. She felt that they had understood eachother in ways that were beyond the boundaries of what words can be described. Sicili had always been a lady of words, she always knew how to phrase her feelings eloquently. Despite what Lesbia saids about Vivara being robotic, Vivara had always felt too much. But her feelings can't be encapulsated in words, or any other forms of expression understandable by other humans, thus she was prone to random fits of tears, and bouts of rage.

 Vivara calculated her odds, if she was to raid this traveling group. It was a congression of twenty people, they appeared to be a large family, with mostly children and the adults at the front and back, like a flock of geese crossing the roads. They did not appear to be heavily armed; and the last two carriages had cargo. Two men had a large boar skewered staff.  She figured if she was to attach she should jump down when the carriage approaches, if she lands on top of it she can have the upperhand. She motioned Renzo to hold off, as she mounted an arrow to her handmade bow.

 Arrow flies down, the driver from the 3rd carriage looks back. Vivara jumps but instead of landing on the carriage she tumbles off its edge falls to the edge. "Halt!" a voice from the carriage she collided with calls. The entire congression stops.

She finds her grounding to get back up, with a dagger in each hand. She throws one knocking a man on a horse off. Several men from the front of the line come towards her, with her other dagger, she rushes to stab one in the abdomen. And using her free fist upper cuts one in the chin. A boy her age holding a spear with both hands jabs towards her. Vio dodges and it slices away her blade, in attempt to doge, she loses her balance and trips. He does not miss the opportunity to keep her down and held the tip of his spear to her neck. Regret and shame overcame Vivara, she can't believe she had been so stupid to attempt to attack this party. She hadn't fought with humans in years. Her biggest opponent had be mountain lions and jackals, and they've long ago stop being a challenge for her. What did her uncle say? The moment you can win on a consistent basis, is the moment you will lose sooner or later.

 The older boy (Yule) asked, "Is the rest of your crew coming to back you up?"

 It took Vivara a long moment to realize he was addressing her. Had she forgotten how to talk? She shook her head.

Ace: Alone.
Yule: Laconic, you'll fit in well with us. I'm Jyri, what's your name?
Ace: *Whoever is hunting my family, are they still looking for me? We are named after the southern Islands, Vivara is not a common name. Mountain people have short names, better to blend in* Ace. I'm Ace. 

Yule: Well Ace, you must be hungry. Com'on violence is never the answer, blood only begets blood.

She nodded and finally blurted "yes, I am" in a mechanical atonal mumble, even though he had not asked her a question.

---

Yule: Jyri is dead, I am reborn. I am Yule.
Ace: Traitor!
*Ace brings her knife to his throat, but it collides with his shield instead. They continue to fight…*

*Yule launches his sword at her, Ace dodges*
Ace: Whatever happened to violence is not the answer?
Yule: Sometimes it is necessary for peace.
Ace: “Blood begets blood” `she slices a wound in abdomen`
Yule: You see how this new government will oppress and enslave so many. We the Church must save them.
Ace: By displacing people from their homes and mass murder?
Yule: Don’t be so high and mighty. You killed to survive, you would have murdered my tribemen's for our food. Yet, we took you in!
Ace: And when the crusades came to our tribe, you blowed down, you let your own parents be burnt. And your younger brother….  Erik is gone because of you.
*Ace starts to tear up.* 

*Someone puts a hand on her shoulder. It turns out to be Jacque.*
Jacque: You do not bear weapons of our organization against our allies.

In a room with a large long table, the surface is a large screen, which is also projected in the screen behind Edgar. Gretchen is on this right and Alan is on his left. 

Edgar: Galei.... *pause* is a nation that welcomes all faiths.
The Order of Lygeia has improve the welfare of the residents of Ixan. But the order has strayed from the kindness of the mother prophet.

*Gretchen and Alan exchange nervous glances*

Edgar: Today they have acted against the citizens of Galei. Today, The Order is no longer welcomed in within our borders.

Gretchen: *speaks into the microphone, addressing the faces on the screen* Senators of Galei, we ask of your cooperation in closing down The Order's churchs in your respective territories.

Senator 1: Uh

Senator 2: I cannot. A few months ago, the Order's armies have taken residence here in Ivonne. As per state _ treatise, we have no militia. We are a musical instrument manufactory territory. Since crime rates are so low, we barely have local law enforcement. 

Senator 1: The order's armies are here too.

*half of the senators all nod in agreement*

Edgar: TRAITORS! *slams his fist into the table screen and breaks it*

*The projector goes dark.*

`Scene: Gretchen and Helga cuddle in bed. Gretchen snuggles into Helga's arm, placing a kiss on the side of her breast.`

Gretchen: For years, we've been relying on the church to help us offer aid to our struggling residents. If we close down all the churches, Galei's social welfare problems will have to pick up the slack. 

Helga: What are the plans for that?

Gretchen: I don't think there is any, that's our government now. With each step we take, we are always three steps behind. `smirks` should have seen the look on Edgar's face when he found out the Roderick had taken hold of several provinces. Some leader of the nation.

Helga: You know, if you want him gone.... I know people

Gretchen: I know `sighs` you know. `Gretchen jumps on top of Helga and kisses her`

`Helga falls a sleep, Gretchen gets up to open her underwear drawer to bring out the vial Zaki gave her in chapter 1.`

`Scene: Jacque explains to the ~10 people in the org in a meeting room with a map of Galei and its surrounding areas`

Jacques: Roderick has already secured the regions in of the Northwest. He is planning to move some forces to move down southward to...

Ace: `looks empty eyed` *No where is safe from the reach of the Order's conquest. They destroyed Atonia's city state's independence with their manipulation, enslaved the mountain tribes. But now I am to help them take over Galei too, if I hope to feed Sici and me.* `tears well up in her eyes`

Jacques: Now I know we are assassins and spies, not military commanders.

`Rein looks in Ace's direction`

Jacques: but I want you to offer your talents to the holy generals of the Order.

`Ace blinks her tears away`

Jacques: Now Rein, head to _ and meet with General _. The south has a much stronger local militia than the North, so Kirk you head south to _ with a team neutralize them.
Ace, Helga, I want you two to meet with local churches in the city to make sure they are in full willing to offer us full support if we need them.

Ace: Are you sure, I shouldn't go with Rein or Kirk? I'm a killer not a talker.

Jacques: `smiles` If the conflicts in Ixan continues to rise, who will be here to protect your sister?

`Ace looks shocked that he just blackmailed her`

`Ace is home drinking a glass of whiskey as Sicili is making dinner`

Ace: How can you work for the Order, when you know what they've done to our family?!

Sicili: It was a High Priest who broke Atonia. A religion is more than the ambitions of one man, even if that man is presently their leader. `serves dinner and brings to to the table`

Ace: You have a point. One of the tenents of the order adovcates for harmony. How has the order slipped so far from the original teachings of the Prophet Lygeia?

Sicili: Power is an ember, isn't that what mom used to say?

Ace: `smiles` You've always listened to her more closely than I ever did.

Sicili: Those words were for you and Lessa, I was never inline to take her place.

Ace: But she wished you were. *I was never the daughter mother wanted to take leadership, but Sicili would have been a great leader of Ella Famiglia d'Alighieri.*

Sicli: I don't have the heart to be the leader of a crime family. I belong with the Order. Let me come with you tomorrow, when you visit the churches. You'll see the good work we for the people.

`Yule is having his room dressed by a nurse-nun`

Yule: *If she got out of being held captive by the church, where's Erik?*

`Flashback: Vio and Erik are sparring in an open field`

`Erik strikes with his spear`

`Ace jumps and lands behind him with her dagger pointed at his back`

Yule: `claps` You are learning how to fight smart. `pets Aces on her head and Eric on his shoulders` Little brother, remember never let your opponent fall out of your sight.

Erik: Guess, I'll just have to a few more eyes

Ace: You can have eyes all over, and still one small brain.

Erik: My small brain is still bigger than your courage.

`Drums sounds, and the church's calvary rolls in.`
