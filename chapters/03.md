# 03: Though storm clouds mask our beloved sun

THEME: Our characters struggle with their chosen authority figure.

Outline: Ace does not want to ally with the church. 

Alan is afraid that the government will fire him if they find out he is gay, and goes through lengths to hid it from his friends and sister

Chelsea knows that going into civil war with the church will destory Ixan, and she does not want to see the country her mother worked so hard to keep peaceful go into ruin. (Plus now that the org is allied with the church, she and Helga will be on opposite sides of the conflict)

- [ ] Fb: The Church visit's Yule's tribe (Ace and Erik are sparing), Rod offers them a chance to join. Claiming that by uniting the tribes there will be safety and prosperity.

Yule joins, and sad he's seen enough bloodshed from warring tribes and too wants unity.
- [ ] Yule ask Rod what they should do about the displaced homeless
- [ ] Edgar employs Zaki

Characters to develop? Yule and Roderick

How can we uses Adolf's knowledge of gov and church officials to push the plot?
There is no resolution to the conflict introduced.

Maybe terms of employment is just a theme in this chapter as opposed to the main plot point in this chapter. What is the actual plot? Or rather what is the story of this chapter?

What do we do about when an unexpected power takes over?
Where do your alliance lies? What factors decide?


Major authority dynamics
Vio - Jacque: transactional
How does Vio deal with her boss wanting to align their organization with the institution that has caused her family(birth/adoptive) so much pain in her early childhood. The Church that has displaced her over and over again. ~ emotion beat

Chelsea - Edgar: spite
How does Chelsea deal with Edgar, the man who got her family exhiled? Balancing her need for the good of the nation v her own personal needs. What is their dynamic? Where Chelsea is composed and aloft, Edgar is easy to anger and takes offense easily. He is a man who moves large pieces over a small cause. Even though he is external reason, "You moved against my citizens, it's more about the fact that Rod fired without consulting him first.

Yule - Roderick: mentor, disillusionment
Probably the most complex of them all, because Yule went in knowing that Rod has harmed his loved ones. Should be the major plot thread of this chapter.

- Yule is back in his quarters, with a wound being dressed by a nurse. Yule still shock that he saw Vio, and reminded of Erik again stumbles. All the wants to ask Vio is where is Erik.
- (fb single page) to when a church campaign invaded Yule's tribe taking Vio and Erik away
- Rod comes by, and nurse bows out. Rod comments on how he did a good job handling the situation. And ask who is Vio (fyi Rod was not there during the invasion of Yule's tribe.)
- Rod comments on how she does not look like someone from the tribes.
- Yule ask how do they plan to get the people to stand by the Church if they had started off the relationship so hostile to the citizens. That long gone are the days of using intimidation and might to take over, especially in large nations as opposed to separate tribe, that even with 2 full nations under their control. They don't have what it takes to go into a full out war.
- Rod comments on how there leader is weak and easily manipulated, he plains to walk Edgar into committing more violence against their citizens, so the events of the cathedral's opening pale in comparision. "Com'on we have to meet our new allies"

- Cuts to scene with Chelsea and Edgar

- Rod & Yule meet with Jacque (Rein & Helga by his side as body guards), Vio follows along in the back. Yule and Vio keep on looking at eachother through the meeting.

- After the meeting Vio and Yule finally talk in private. Yule asks about Erik.
- Vio tells the story of how she and Erik got separated.
- Angst about all the terrible things the Church has done to people she loved, and can't believe that she now has to work for them.
Yule: well would you rather work for the government?
Vio: Why do I have to choose sides, if I am not with you, doesn't mean I am against you.

- Zaki gets hired by Edgar to keep a watch on people of the org

Minor power dynamics
Adolf - Alan : transactional by default, but can get murky.
Zaki - Edgar : transactional

It has been years since Vivara had seen another human being. Since she's been separated from her sister and cousin the night she lived in a cave in the forest alone. She would have never guessed the snare skills uncle _ had taught her became her lifeline for surviving. In these mountains paths are narrow, and inclines steep. Traveler prefer to take the valleys. Vivara peered at the rather lengthy procession of travelers through the evergreens. Renzo, a wild dog she had befriend sometime back started to growl. Renzo and Eleonora, a her hunting raven has been the only living creatures she kept company. Ever since she was a child, she had always found comfort in the company of animals. Her family kept guard dogs of course. She and Sicili would sneak out during her parent's parties, when Vivara got overwhelmed by the guest to play with them. Then the night when her family's estate got raided, all thirteen of the hounds were found near the stables, each baring multiple gunshot wounds, all dead. In all the eleven years of her life, they had been her only true friends. She loved Sicili, but she was always something Vivara had to protect. But with her dogs, they were different, their connection was mutual. She felt that they had understood eachother in ways that were beyond the boundaries of what words can be described. Sicili had always been a lady of words, she always knew how to phrase her feelings eloquently. Despite what Lesbia saids about Vivara being robotic, Vivara had always felt too much. But her feelings can't be encapulsated in words, or any other forms of expression understandable by other humans, thus she was prone to random fits of tears, and bouts of rage.

 Vivara calculated her odds, if she was to raid this traveling group. It was a congression of twenty people, they appeared to be a large family, with mostly children and the adults at the front and back, like a flock of geese crossing the roads. They did not appear to be heavily armed; and the last two carriages had cargo. Two men had a large boar skewered staff.  She figured if she was to attach she should jump down when the carriage approaches, if she lands on top of it she can have the upperhand. She motioned Renzo to hold off, as she mounted an arrow to her handmade bow.

 Arrow flies down, the driver from the 3rd carriage looks back. Vivara jumps but instead of landing on the carriage she tumbles off its edge falls to the edge. "Halt!" a voice from the carriage she collided with calls. The entire congression stops.

 > (TODO write attack scene) Actually she should put up a good fight scene, and ends up squaring off with a boy her age, Erik.

The boy (Erik) held the tip of his sword to her neck. Regret and shame overcame Vivara, she can't believe she had been so stupid to attempt to attack this party. She hadn't fought with humans in years. Her biggest opponent had be mountain lions and jackals, and they've long ago stop being a challenge for her. What did her uncle say? The moment you can win on a consistent basis, is the moment you will lose sooner or later.

 The older boy (Yule) asked, "Is the rest of your crew coming to back you up?"

 It took Vivara a long moment to realize he was addressing her. Had she forgotten how to talk? She shook her head. Ace: Alone.
Yule: Laconic, you'll fit in well with us. You must be hungry, com'on violence is never the answer, blood only begets blood.

She nodded and finally blurted "yes, I am" in a mechanical atonal mumble, even though he had not asked her a question.

Yule: Jyri is dead, I am reborn. I am Yule.
Ace: Traitor!
*Ace brings her knife to his throat, but it collides with his sheild instead. They continue to fight…

*Yule launches his spear at her, Ace dodges*
Ace: Whatever happened to violence is not the answer?
Yule: Sometimes it is necessary for peace.
Ace: “Blood begets blood”
Yule: You see how this new government will oppress and enslave so many. We the Church must save them.
Ace: By displacing people from their homes and mass murder?
Yule: Don’t be so high and mighty. You killed to survive, you would have murdered my tribemen's for our food. And we took you in!
Ace: And when the crusades came to our tribe, you blowed down, you let your own parents be burnt. And your younger brother….  Erik is gone because of you.
*Ace starts to tear up.* 

*Someone puts a hand on her shoulder. It turns out to be Jacque.*
Jacque: You do not bear weapons of our organization against our allies.
