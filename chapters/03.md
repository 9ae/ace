They had been traveling for a few days. Initially they made great strides up the peninsula, but now their pace has lagged, and  they are making their way through the mountain range that guarded Atonia’s norther border. Vivara and Sicili's father was from a noble family in the far east. Far enough where they hoped High Priest Roderick's scheming would not get to them. Over the last few years, her parent’s would whisper in private about their growing worry with the Church's involvement in affairs of the Atonia states. While tension had always existed between the Atonia states,  the High Priest has been stoking the flames in Atonia ~~, ever since his twin sister Madelaine went missing. Vivo wondered how many nations she would flip, and levels of hells she would raise, if Sicili ever disappeared~~. She looked over at her sleeping younger sister curled up in the corner of the carriage. Throughout the journey the girls took turns driving the coach.  Lesbia had always been steady coachmen, which is why Vivara was surprised when the carriage came to a sudden stop.  She poked her head out,  to find the drive seat empty.  

“Lessa!”, Vivara hopped out. Her cousin was unconscious on the ground with a dart in her neck. Their horses panicked and a pack of men descend upon them from the slope above their path. Their crescent shaped knifes gleamed in the moonlight.

While Uncle Ardino had taught Lesbia and Vivara multiple forms of martial arts warding off on seven grown men  is going to be a challenge.  Vivara regretted jumping out of the carriage unarmed.  She should have grabbed her crossbow or Lesbia’s sword. But Sicili is too gentle to be a fighter, and with her cousin unconscious she she must protect whoever is left of her family alone.  She launched at there nearest bandit with a jump kick to his chin. ~~The rest of the fight was a blur.~~

> (TODO write fight scenes)

The next thing she remembered was toppling over Lesbia, her stomach wound staining her cousins blonde hair. Maybe it was easier give up, maybe they had been meant to burn with their estate, and Death cased them down, to the treacherous mountains, for it will have its souls. “Lessa, I’ve failed.” Vivara cried. She rested her head against her cousin’s slowly but still beating heart.

“Ah!!!” one of the bandits had dragged Sicili out of the carriage, but the tresses of her hair.

“How adorable, innocent,” he muttered.  “How deliciously corruptible,” he said as he tear Sicli’s petticoat.

Vivara snatched Lesbia’s riding crop and aimed for the bandit, who’ had his knife pointed at Sicili with his  right hand, and was undoing his trousers with left . The tail of the whip circled around his  right wrist, and she tugged. hard. He dropped both his knife and and trousers dropped simultaneously.  

It looked as if he was well prepared to commit terrible actions to a nine year old girl. Vivara sweep up to catch the falling knife. In a double handed grip she lounged her bladed at him. He still held on to the part of him that was no longer part of his body. His blood and screams escaped him like a river breaking through a dam.  His comrades all turned towards Vivara,  she let out a sly smile, as she wiped the blood that had rained on her face. The remaining four bandits who was still alive all fled.

All this commotion had upset the horses, and when Vivara tried to calm them down, Midnight in jumped and knocked her down the ledge of their mountain path. That night was the last time she saw her sister and cousin in a for a very long time.

It has been years since Vivara had seen another human being. Since she's been separated from her sister and cousin the night she lived in a cave in the forest alone. She would have never guessed the snare skills uncle _ had taught her became her lifeline for surviving. In these mountains paths are narrow, and inclines steep. Traveler prefer to take the valleys. Vivara peered at the rather lengthy caravan of travelers through the evergreens. Renzo, a wild dog she had befriend sometime back started to growl. Renzo and Eleonora, her hunting raven has been the only living creatures she kept company. Ever since she was a child, she had always found comfort in the company of animals. Her family kept guard dogs of course. She and Sicili would sneak out during her parent's parties, when Vivara got overwhelmed by the guest to play with them. Then the night when her family's estate got raided, all thirteen of the hounds were found near the stables, each baring multiple gunshot wounds, all dead. In all the eleven years of her life, they had been her only true friends. She loved Sicili, but she was always something Vivara had to protect. But with her dogs, they were different, their connection was mutual. She felt that they had understood eachother in ways that were beyond the boundaries of what words can be described. Sicili had always been a lady of words, she always knew how to phrase her feelings eloquently. Despite what Lesbia saids about Vivara being robotic, Vivara had always felt too much. But her feelings can't be encapulsated in words, or any other forms of expression understandable by other humans, thus she was prone to random fits of tears, and bouts of rage.

 Vivara calculated her odds, if she was to raid this caravan group. It was a congression of eight carriages, each lead by a white horse (uncommon in this mountain rage). They did not appear to be heavily armed; and the last two carriages had cargo. She figured if she was to attach she should jump down when the fifth carriage comes up, if she lands on top of it she can have the upperhand. She motioned Renzo to hold off, as she mounted an arrow to her handmade bow.

 Arrow flies down, the driver from the 3rd carriage looks back. Vivara jumps but instead of landing on the fifth carriage she tumbles off its edge falls to the edge. "Halt!" a voice from the carriage she collided with calls. The entire congression stops.

 > (TODO write attack scene) Actually she should put up a good fight scene

 From the carriage comes out a boy about Vivara's age, followed by a tall older man. The boy is wearing an amoured breast plate and breeches; his companion the older man is in a long white robe that matched the horses' majestic mane.
 The boy held the tip of his sword to her neck. Regret and shame overcame Vivara, she can't believe she had been so stupid to attempt to attack this party. She hadn't fought with humans in years. Her biggest opponent had be mountain lions and jackals, and they've long ago stop being a challenge for her. What did her uncle say? The moment you can win on a consistent basis, is the moment you will lose sooner or later.
 The man in the robe walked up next to the boy, "Is the rest of your crew coming to back you up?"

 It took Vivara a long moment to realize he was addressing her. Had she forgotten how to talk? She shook her head.
 Then he followed up with, "you must be hungry". She nodded and finally blurted "yes, I am" in a mechanical atonal mumble, even though he had not asked her a question.

Ace: Whatever happened to violence is not the answer?
Yule: Sometimes it is necessary for peace.
Ace: “Blood begets blood”
Yule: You see how this new government will oppress and enslave so many. We the Church must save them.
Ace: By a bombing that kills innocents?
Yule: By making a statement. Don’t be so high and mighty. You killed to survive, you kill on assignment.
Death by itself is not a punishment, but it is punishment for those around them. Your organization made children orphans.
Ace: And your so called church, enslaved orphans.
