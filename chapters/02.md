# 02: Though storm clouds mask our beloved sun (Vienna Teng - Lullaby)
Flashback to Ace and Yule
Yule tells Ace about how they threaten his family’s village and forced them to convert.
He was the chief’s son, and was kept as hostage to make sure that their clan allied with the church.
The church took him and a few other children, who’s parents were burnt as heretics. Erik was one of them.

Viva’s family fleeing from fic-italy. There carriage got raided by bandits, Ace was separated from Sicili and Lesbia. For several years, Viva lived alone in the mountains with the knives she took from the bandits to hunt. Every night she prayed for her sister and cousin. When she was 14, missionaries found her, when she tried to raid their camp. Yule reasoned with her that the right thing to do was join them. Today: Ace and Yule face off again, Yule now a crusader, with blood on his hands.

Vivara had always loved the feeling of the morning sun against her skin. It reminded of of those years, when she lived alone in the mountains where she would spend her nights on a hammock high up on the trees.  Being high up, above the happenings of other creatures made her feel safe.  From an aerial view, she was able to see her world objectively. Vivara watched as the city slowly came to life Zaki’s ceiling flat.

“Look at them go, gears in an automata.” Zaki said as he encircled a arm around her waist. Vivara flinched, she normally does not like being touched; it has always felt invasive and whenever there is skin to skin contact, she had always felt that touch linger, and she would have to rub it off later. But when he puller her closer and  placed his lips in the side of the neck, she feels that maybe just once, she would not mind the feel of his lips linger with her today.

She turned towards him, hoping to replace her neck with her lips. But Zaki’s  head shot up. “Let’s get you home.”

“You don’t have to come with me”, Vivara said not wanting to trouble him.

Zaki touched his forehead to hers, and looked lazily into her eyes. “I’ve shown you mine. Now it’s time for you to show me yours.”

It was already almost noon by the time Zaki and Vivara made it out to the streets.  Illyria was a city that rose early, with everyone getting to work in a timely fashion, taking lunch in their offices.  She streets were quiet, and mostly barren. The exception was a block with multiple tents, and make shift sleeping setups. There sat people with tattered clothes, and starring angrily at the ground, wistfully at the blue tent, which we call the sky, or hopefully at the pedestrians who past by.  

“This block used to be tenement homes,” Zaki explained. “Government  owned, but then the major sold it to a private company.”

“And the company sold it to the church”, Ace finished the narrative. She looked up at the grandiose cathedral being constructed. 

As the turned the corner to pass by the would be entrance to the cathedral was a crowd of cleaner smelling people, marching and yelling and they rose and bared signs, which said “right to shelter”, “God’s home should be everyone’s home”, “private projects lead to piracy”.

Ace: Whatever happened to violence is not the answer?
Yule: Sometimes it is necessary for peace.
Ace: “Blood begets blood”
Yule: You see how this new government will oppress and enslave so many. We the Church must save them.
Ace: By a bombing that kills innocents?
Yule: By making a statement. Don’t be so high and mighty. You killed to survive, you kill on assignment.
Death by itself is not a punishment, but it is punishment for those around them. Your organization made children orphans.
Ace: And your so called church, enslaved orphans.
