Autumn nights in Renova are quiet with only the howling of the wind. But this evening the Alighieri estate had been lively, for it was Sicili's eight birthday dinner. While Vivo did not have any friends, Sicili was a social butterfly. Everyone at their academy loved her, and father invited her whole class over for the day. There was a magician who had the quickest hand, and entire string quartet, for Sicili recently had sudden love for the violin. And to everyone's surprise the after the cake was cut, Atonia's finest ballet troupe came all the way from Girasole Conservatory to perform for Sicili. It was by far the finest celebration Alighieri sisters ever had. Vivo can't help to be a little jealous.

Even long after everyone has left, Sici is still edging from excitement of the day, and she bounced and hummed, while Vivo brushed her hair. Their peaceful winding ritual was interrupted by a hurried knocking on their bed chambers' door. Vivo went to answer it to find her older cousin, Lessa. "Girls, quick get into your travel gear. We must go!"

"What why?!" Vivo asked, she was not one to blindly follow commands.

"We are under attack!" Lessa explained hurriedly.

Vivo turned towards her younger sister who walked up to the door beside her. "Sici, it's time."

They had always known something like this may happen. Atonia was far from united sovereignty and more like a collection of city states, which all coincidentally spoke the same language. Leadership fell to the arms of local noble families, ancient clans, or warlords. Power belonged to the mighty, and those _ enough to enforce their might. The Alighieri were a powerful family, and like all powerful entities, they were not short on enemies.

There was always a threat that they may be kidnap by their parent's rivals, held for ransom, or murdered to be set as an example. Uncle Ardino had trained Lessa and Vivo at a very young age to fight, and if they need to how to kill a man triple their size.

The Alighieri girls, quickly got dressed and followed Lessa down to the stables.

"Where are my parents?" Vivo asked as they made their way quietly through the house.

"Handling the situation," Lessa answered.

"Then I must help! I can't leave them to risk their lives for us," Vivo cried.

"You'll put them in more danger, if they are trying to protect you. Stop being so selfish," this time it was Sicili who spoke.

"But," Vivo knew her younger sister was right. Yet she felt so wrong for leaving mom and dad.

"No buts," said Lessa. "When your mother became the leader of the the Alighieri family my dad swore to her that I will keep her family safe, and I will help my family keep that promise."

When they reached the stables, there was an odd odor of rust and iron. Vivo did not stop to investigate as they gathered Lessa and Sici's favorite stallions, Midnight and Moonlight, and choosen a carriage for the long journey ahead. The three Alighieri girls, escaped towards the forest surrounding the estate. It was not until they were out of the stable and passing through the field did they realize what the iron scent was. All thirteen of the family's guard dogs, motionless, in pools of blood their own blood. Her favorite hound, Diego, bared seven bullet wounds upon his gray coat, now stained in scarlet.

'Diego!', Vivo's jolted up. Every inch of her soaked, her body in sweat and face in tears. She breathed short and choked breathes. Next to her laid Zaki, his bare chest bandaged from the wound she inflicted with her knives. One of his arms splayed out above her pillow, the other on his belly, his mouth hung slightly open. She wondered if someone saw his man sleeping, would they ever think he was a contract killer? Then again, she wondered what people thought of her sleeping form.

Vivara had always loved the feeling of the morning sun against her skin. It reminded of of those years, when she lived alone in the mountains where she would spend her nights on a hammock high up on the trees.  Being high up, above the happenings of other creatures made her feel safe.  From an aerial view, she was able to see her world objectively. Vivara watched as the city slowly came to life Zaki’s ceiling flat.

“Look at them go, gears in an automata.” Zaki said as he encircled a arm around her waist. Vivara flinched, she normally does not like being touched; it has always felt invasive and whenever there is skin to skin contact, she had always felt that touch linger, and she would have to rub it off later. But when he puller her closer and  placed his lips in the side of the neck, she feels that maybe just once, she would not mind the feel of his lips linger with her today.

She turned towards him, hoping to replace her neck with her lips. But Zaki’s  head shot up. “Let’s get you home.”

“You don’t have to come with me”, Vivara said not wanting to trouble him.

Zaki touched his forehead to hers, and looked lazily into her eyes. “I’ve shown you mine. Now it’s time for you to show me yours.”

It was already almost noon by the time Zaki and Vivara made it out to the streets.  Ixan was a city that rose early, with everyone getting to work in a timely fashion, taking lunch in their offices.  She streets were quiet, and mostly barren. The exception was a block with multiple tents, and make shift sleeping setups. There sat people with tattered clothes, and starring angrily at the ground, wistfully at the blue tent, which we call the sky, or hopefully at the pedestrians who past by.  

“This block used to be tenement homes,” Zaki explained. “Government  owned, but then the major sold it to a private company.”

“And the company sold it to the church”, Ace finished the narrative. She looked up at the grandiose cathedral being constructed.

As the turned the corner to pass by the would be entrance to the cathedral was a crowd of cleaner smelling people, marching and yelling and they rose and bared signs, which said “right to shelter”, “God’s home should be everyone’s home”, “private projects lead to piracy”.

When Vivara and Zaki arrived to her flat, Sicili greeted them from the kitchen.

“Hi sis, this is Zaki, he was on the same case as me.” Vivara introduced him. She motioned to her sister, “and Zaki this is my sister”

“Sicili, right” Zaki eagerly grabbed her hand. “Vivo has told me so much about you.”

Vivara looked puzzled, she definitely did not recall telling Zaki anything about her family. That’s part of the job of being an assassin, keep your family away from anyone you come into contact with at work. Especially if they may be working with an opposing side.  It was part of the reason, why she was hesitant to allow Zaki to come home with her. But she couldn’t worry too much, when her pager buzzed.

Ace: Whatever happened to violence is not the answer?
Yule: Sometimes it is necessary for peace.
Ace: “Blood begets blood”
Yule: You see how this new government will oppress and enslave so many. We the Church must save them.
Ace: By a bombing that kills innocents?
Yule: By making a statement. Don’t be so high and mighty. You killed to survive, you kill on assignment.
Death by itself is not a punishment, but it is punishment for those around them. Your organization made children orphans.
Ace: And your so called church, enslaved orphans.
