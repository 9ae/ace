Autumn nights in Renova are quiet with only the howling of the wind. But this evening the Alighieri estate had been lively, for it was Sicili's eight birthday dinner. While Vivo did not have any friends, Sicili was a social butterfly. Everyone at their academy loved her, and father invited her whole class over for the day. There was a magician who had the quickest hand, and entire string quartet, for Sicili recently had sudden love for the violin. And to everyone's surprise the after the cake was cut, Atonia's finest ballet troupe came all the way from Girasole Conservatory to perform for Sicili. It was by far the finest celebration Alighieri sisters ever had. Vivo can't help to be a little jealous.

Even long after everyone has left, Sici is still edging from excitement of the day, and she bounced and hummed, while Vivo brushed her hair. Their peaceful winding ritual was interrupted by a hurried knocking on their bed chambers' door. Vivo went to answer it to find her older cousin, Lessa. "Girls, quick get into your travel gear. We must go!"

"What why?!" Vivo asked, she was not one to blindly follow commands.

"We are under attack!" Lessa explained hurriedly.

Vivo turned towards her younger sister who walked up to the door beside her. "Sici, it's time."

They had always known something like this may happen. Atonia was far from united sovereignty and more like a collection of city states, which all coincidentally spoke the same language. Leadership fell to the arms of local noble families, ancient clans, or warlords. Power belonged to the mighty, and those _ enough to enforce their might. The Alighieri were a powerful family, and like all powerful entities, they were not short on enemies.

There was always a threat that they may be kidnap by their parent's rivals, held for ransom, or murdered to be set as an example. Uncle Ardino had trained Lessa and Vivo at a very young age to fight, and if they need to how to kill a man triple their size.

The Alighieri girls, quickly got dressed and followed Lessa down to the stables.

"Where are my parents?" Vivo asked as they made their way quietly through the house.

"Handling the situation," Lessa answered.

"Then I must help! I can't leave them to risk their lives for us," Vivo cried.

"You'll put them in more danger, if they are trying to protect you. Stop being so selfish," this time it was Sicili who spoke.

"But," Vivo knew her younger sister was right. Yet she felt so wrong for leaving mom and dad.

"No buts," said Lessa. "When your mother became the leader of the the Alighieri family my dad swore to her that I will keep her family safe, and I will help my family keep that promise."

When they reached the stables, there was an odd odor of rust and iron. Vivo did not stop to investigate as they gathered Lessa and Sici's favorite stallions, Midnight and Moonlight, and choosen a carriage for the long journey ahead. The three Alighieri girls, escaped towards the forest surrounding the estate. It was not until they were out of the stable and passing through the field did they realize what the iron scent was. All thirteen of the family's guard dogs, motionless, in pools of blood their own blood. Her favorite was a Spanish hound, Diego, bared seven bullet wounds upon his gray coat, now stained in scarlet. 

- - - -

'Diego!', Vivo's jolted up. Every inch of her soaked, her body in sweat and face in tears. She breathed short and choked breathes. The memory of that night, had made her feel so helpless. She remembered vowing to never let the suffering of those around her happen, not if she can stop it.  Next to her laid Zaki, his bare chest bandaged from the wound she inflicted with her knives. One of his arms splayed out above her pillow, the other on his belly, his mouth hung slightly open. She wondered if someone saw his man sleeping, would they ever think he was a contract killer? Then again, she wondered what people thought of her sleeping form.

Vivara had always loved the feeling of the morning sun against her skin. It reminded of of those years, when she lived alone in the mountains where she would spend her nights on a hammock high up on the trees.  Being high up, above the happenings of other creatures made her feel safe.  From an aerial view, she was able to see her world objectively. Vivara watched as the city slowly came to life Zaki’s ceiling flat.

“Look at them go, gears in an automata.” Zaki said as he encircled a arm around her waist. Vivara flinched, she normally does not like being touched; it has always felt invasive and whenever there is skin to skin contact, she had always felt that touch linger, and she would have to rub it off later. But when he puller her closer and  placed his lips in the side of the neck, she feels that maybe just once, she would not mind the feel of his lips linger with her today.

She turned towards him, hoping to replace her neck with her lips. But Zaki’s  head shot up. “Let’s get you home.”

“You don’t have to come with me”, Vivara said not wanting to trouble him.

Zaki touched his forehead to hers, and looked lazily into her eyes. “I’ve shown you mine. Now it’s time for you to show me yours.”

- - - -

It was already almost noon by the time Zaki and Vivara made it out to the streets.  Ixan was a city that rose early, with everyone getting to work in a timely fashion, taking lunch in their offices.  She streets were quiet, and mostly barren. The exception was a block with multiple tents, and make shift sleeping setups. There sat people with tattered clothes, and starring angrily at the ground, wistfully at the blue tent, which we call the sky, or hopefully at the pedestrians who past by.

“This block used to be tenement homes,” Zaki explained. “Government  owned, but then the major sold it to a private company.”

“And the company sold it to the church”, Ace finished the narrative. She looked up at the grandiose cathedral being constructed.

As the turned the corner to pass by the would be entrance to the cathedral was a crowd of cleaner smelling people, marching and yelling and they rose and bared signs, which said “right to shelter”, “God’s home should be everyone’s home”, “private projects lead to piracy”.

When Vivara and Zaki arrived to her flat, Sicili greeted them from the kitchen.

“Hi sis, this is Zaki, he was on the same case as me.” Vivara introduced him. She motioned to her sister, “and Zaki this is my sister”

“Sicili, right” Zaki eagerly grabbed her hand. “Vivo has told me so much about you.”

Vivara looked puzzled, she definitely did not recall telling Zaki anything about her family. That’s part of the job of being an assassin, keep your family away from anyone you come into contact with at work. Especially if they may be working with an opposing side.  It was part of the reason, why she was hesitant to allow Zaki to come home with her.  While she was pondering this particular scene, her pager buzzed.

“Would you like some coffee?” Sicili offered their guest.

“Coffee would be lovely,”  said Zaki eventually letting go of her hand. “Thank you.”

“Sis, would you also like some?” Sicilia asked.

“No, I must get to work,” Vivara said as she headed out the door,

“The bombing of the Department of Housing building happened around 8am this morning,” Rein explained. He was a broad shouldered assassin, with pale blond hair, and emerald eyes, 5 years older than Vivara.  Many of the younger trainees harbored a crush on him, but to the girls he was unattainable as he preferred the company of men.

“Was there a call, or threat warning beforehand?” Vivara asked.

“No, call or warning to evacuate,” said Rein. “But luckily most employees have not arrived yet. There were five casualties, and no deaths.”

“And (TODO name of org leader) wants us to investigate because… he wants to find out who else is going after the government?” ask Vivara.

“Yes, with the state of the homeless crisis over the past ten years, there are a lot of unhappy people.  Everyone is angry with our parliaments inability to  make changes.”

“But whoever did this, is clearly trying to make a statement more than solve any problems,” Vivara observed.

“And we have to find out who they are, and what they want to say.  Are they linked thus in anyway? If so, their action just put all us of at the risk of exposure,” Rein said firmly.

- - - -

"And you are you heard nothing about the bombing", Vivara stated as her knife travel down the lanky's abdomen.
He had his hand tied above his head, and anchored to a beam in an old warehouse. He had belonged to had been the sixth organized crime family, Rein and Vivara hit up to investigate the bombings.

"Yes, I told you," he cried. "We would be stupid to attack in such an out right way. Bombings, mass shootings are they art of your people. Hastuit immigrants are not fool hardly, we have to be cunning to survive in foreign lands, after our home got decimated by the Church."

"Cunning, eh?" Rein spoke up. "You know, my partner here," he nods to Vivara "is known as the castrating killer, she will make you hard, and then make you bleed hard. If you are not completely honest with us, even so professed wits won't help you."

The Hastuit boy whimpered. "We'll take your for your word," said Vivara as she toss her knife in the air to cut the rope that dangled him from the ceiling, "for now." He dropped several feet to the floor landed on his hands and knees.

When Rein and Vivara left the warehouse, "That sure was a waste of time," said Rein.

"I get a feeling we are missing something," pondered Vivara. "Maybe it's time to pay a visit to some friends on the inside. To see if they found out more about the bombing."

The walk between Alan's precinct and home had recently turned pleasant. A street violinist started playing two blocks from his apartment. Every morning he would take the long away to work just to here him play. He was a blond boy, a little around his age. He would close his eyes when he played ~~, as if he cared not what became of the spare change in his violin case.~~ Alan wondered what did the boy see when he closed his eyes; what peaks and valleys did he see to aid him in improvising his enchanting melodies. Alan can't help to be smitten by both the boy and his songs. Unfortunately the violinist was not here this afternoon. Disappointed Alan sprinted to his apartment, Ada would be angry if he was late for high tea yet again.

The Hart siblings are creatures of habit. Every day at exactly three hours past noon, they would have sit together along for tea. Ada dropped four sugar cubes in the cup for her brother, and carried over the tea and treats on a silver platter to their drafting table. Vivo wondered where she was going to put the platter as every inch of table is covered in files and papers. Alan made room by sweeping his arm along the table, pushing the clutter aside, and a few documents fell to floor. Neither sibling seemed concerned about the documents, as Ada set the platter down.

Alan reached for a chocolate eclair, "Great! I am starving. We've been investigating the bombing all day."

"What did you find?" asked Rein.

Ada answered, "according to the security footage it was one of the night guards who planted the bomb, but we couldn't question him because he's still unconscious in the hospital."

"Yi Han did some digging into his history," Alan interjected with still with a mouth full. Ada gave him a disapproving look, one their mother would give them when she expected better from her children. Alan took a sip of tea and swallowed his food before speaking again. "and came up null. No criminal history, ties to organized crime, or terrorist organizations. He just lives with his wife and son on the east side of town. Neighbors said he's a regular church attendee, and frequently volunteers to coach youth sports. Coworkers call him happy and respectful. This dude is a snore. Maybe that's why he did it, just got bored one day and decided to go postal."

"Does his son attend public or private school," asked Rein.

"Public, I think." Alan replied.

"And you say he's on the east side? There schools aren't great. What does his wife do?"

"She's a caretaker for the senior center," Ada read from a file.

"It is possible, that they are tight in finances, with east side schools shutting down, he could have took money from someone else to plant the bomb." Vivara speculated. "Can you request a warrant to look up their recent transactions?"

"And in! Their finances over the past year seems looks routine," said Alan as he scrolled through the guard's bank history. They all looked at him curiously. "What?! Our banking security systems are elementary. Plus it's going to take days to get that warrant."

"He could be paid in cash," Rein suggested.

"It's rather peculiar that the Department of Housing got bombed the same week the tenement protest is happening," Ada speculates.

"That's true, do you think the kids protesting were responsible?" asked Vivo.

"Not sure," said Ada. "But I can look into it."

- - - -

Ada and Yi Han has been doing interviewing people for as long as they have been working in the police. Yi Han has the uncanny talent of never forgetting, and Ada's upbringing as a daughter of diplomats made her  charming, mild mannered, and someone everyone feels like they can open up to. They walked along the line of protestors camped outside the cathedral.

Some of the campers were previous tenants of the housing project, now demolished to the cathedral. One women sat in front of her tent with her bulldog, she had short hair that was starting to grow into a mullet. There was man in a white sleeveless shirt, eyes sullen and bones protruding. He didn't even have a tent, just a sleeping bag and a large suitcase. None of these people seem capable of planning a bombing, if day to day is a challenge.

Then there are the college students, bright eyed and hopeful, baring signs that said "GOD'S HOME SHOULD BE A SANCTUARY FOR ALL","DISPLACE ME NOT", and "CHURCH'S WAR ON THE HASTUIT STOPS TODAY". One girl is holding a sign that saids "THE CHURCH'S SLOW SECRET CONQUEST OF IXAN STOPS TODAY".

Ada walked up to her, "Hi, my name is Adeline, and this is my friend Han”, she said her best Hanon accent. “We are am touring from Chundu. We are wondering why is everyone camped outside this block."

"This entire block use to house those people," she pointed to the displaced tenants on the street. "It was government subsidized housing for low income families and refugees."

"And then what happened?"  said Ada.

"We've been experiencing budget cuts for a while, and our last prime minister sold many government owned properties to private holders. This tenement block was one of them. The new owners got away with rent control. Many families couldn't afford the raise in rent, when the buildings occupancy reached below 30%, they sold the property to the church," she explained.

"Isn't the property owner suppose to pay tenants a portion of the sell price?" asked Ada.

"Yes, but they paid them their rent price, and since it is still a subsidized rent, they can't use that money to be find housing elsewhere because it has become really expensive to live in Ixan. Many people get by squatting at abandoned factories and warehouses."

"That is terrible," said Ada.

The girl continued, she must be on a roll, and is excited to have someone to listen to her. "But what is worst is the church has been buying those properties too. And no one knows about it because since they are designated residential areas, they are not displacing anyone according to the eyes of the law."

"Why is the church buying old factories and warehouse?" asked Ada.

"I don't know, but if you are interested you should talk with YODA." said the girl.

"Yoda who?" said Ada.

"Youth of Dynamic Action, here let me write down the contact of one of their reps," the girl said eagerly.

- - - -

"This is not one bit shady," commented Yi Han, as he and Ada and Vivo hung looked around an alley way.

"This is the address she gave," said Ada looking at the paper, the protester she spoke with had written for her.

"Well that's why you have me," said Ada.

"That's why we have Charlie and Alexis," Yi Han motioned to his hip, where a handgun was holstered to each side.

In the secluded alley a windchime jingles, it is ornate, a hybrid between dream catcher and miniature chandelier.

"I think that's our cue," said Ada pointing up to the windchime, five stories high at the window of a fire escape.

"Great, how do we get up there?" said Yi Han. The fire escape in the first two floors had rotted away.

"Probably with this," said Vivo, picking up a harnest and rope hanging from the side the fire escape.

"What do kids theses days have against front doors," sighed Ada.

"Didn't you hear? Scaling up walls is all the rave these days," commented Yi Han.

The three of the took turns scaling up the wall of an abandoned factory. By the time the last one came up, a head appeared through the embroidered drapery scaring the party. A man, with blond hair and trimmed but outgrown beard opened the window half way. "If a tree falls," he started.

"Will its leaves cause a ripple in Walden Pond?" finished Ada.

He smiled and opened the window fully, "welcome kinsfolk."

They tumbled through the window into a room that smelled of incense one moment and eucalyptus the next. It was a museum collection through the ages, with time and origins scrambled. There was a lot of furniture from Western Hanon, Tson woodcuts, Atonian ornaments, all existing in an industrial Galeion factory.

"My name is Nobi, and I will bring you to see one of our high priest." said the bearded man. They all doubted that was his real name, but who doesn't go by a pseudonym once in a while after all most of Ixan know Vivo as "Ace, the castrating assassin".

They exit the room and went through a hallway. It was adorned with portraits, no one they recognized. But each of the portrait subjects had an air about them, the type of force that draws a moth to a flame. Nobi lead them to a room on the left.  The entire room was dressed the shades of indigo. At the far end of the room was a women in violet translucent robes, each layer of fabric overlapping each other. She sits tall on the floor with her eyes closed and hands resting on her knees. She had long frizzy salt and peppered hair that touched the floor. She was pale, her lips thin and closed.

Nobi kneed and addressed her "Priest Lana." She opened her eyes, they too were a deep shade of purple. "These kinsfolk have come to see you, regarding the church's secret plan."

Lana nodded and motioned him to leave, Nobi slowly got up and exit the room. She her eyes first landed on Yi Han, then Ada, and last it held with Vivo. "You," she motioned to Vivo, "I see in you great darkness, in a path from the past, and the untrodden road of what is to come. Blood will spill by your hands, or it already has, you will lead armies."

"I am afraid you are mistaken," Vivo interrupted. "I am just a lowly killer, I have no wish to lead. My only wish to provide safety and comfort to my sister. We came here to discuss matters of the state and church not our unseen destiny."

"Every well," said Lana with a little disappointed sigh.

"We came to inquire the purchasing of disused spaces by the church," explained Yi Han.

"Galei is a wonderful nation, a very generous nation," Lana started. "Perpetually accepting people from all over the continent. The tired, the hungry, and yet good intentions, without a plan is like a dream catcher without a net."

"We know the refugees come here, but with little to no support system and integration into Galeion life," said Ada. "And many who didn't have a place to stay, ended up living in the abandoned building on the edge of the city. And the church has been buying them up. But why?"

"For their crusade of course," said Lana in a much louder voice.

"But their crusade has been going on for ages!" said Vivo. "Is it because most of the tenants in those places are Hastuit? And because they are the only people who openly opposed the expansion of the church because they follow another deity?"

"Partially yes," said Lana. "But there is something more suspicious than that. The tenement block they bought, that was to erect the cathedral. We see it, and what they did with the land. But what about the warehouses? They are still warehouses, what does Roderick want warehouses?"

"Land investment perhaps?" said Yi Han.

"Armory and artillery," said Lana. "The church is gearing up for war here. Galei is next. It took Atonian city states, and the Hastuit nations, it took Cella, and Basque, we are next."

*This is insane,* though Vivo. *We are at the pit of some conspiracy theorist.*

"If you don't believe me," said Lana almost as if she read Vivo's doubts. "Go ask Mazin Alamdi, he squating at the old pencil factory, until the church kicked everyone in that building out. He went back a few weeks after to get a family heirloom he hidden there. Ask him what he saw."
 
- - - -

It was late when Vivo got home; all lights were out in her apartment, and since Sicili and her share the same room, she didn’t turn on the lights in fear it will wake her sister up. Tired from the long day of running around, she did not notice another presence in her room.  

“Long day, huh?” came low whisper. Vivo almost lounged her knife towards the sound until she saw Zaki’s face illuminated by the moonlight.

After they make their way out of the bedroom, Vivo answers “It’s been a wild goose chase.”

“If there’s anything I can do,” started Zaki.

“No, I think…” Vivo had always been in the habit of taking on responsibilities alone; but maybe this one mission he might be of help. “Do  speak Astlor?”

“Why?” said Zaki with an eyebrow raised. “Because of the color of my skin, you assume I spoke Astlor? Not all Hastuit get along with each other you know.  My parents are from Thoth, most of the ones in this city are from Nuna. They can tell from my accent. Not sure they want to be conversing with someone from the country that was their oppressors for centuries.“

Schooled and guilty, Vivo turned away and said, “Never mind.” 

“Let me come with you, if my tongue offers you no protection, my skin still may give you some in. They won’t like an Atonian girl like you, questioning them alone,” said Zaki.

“I am half Tsuon,” corrected Vivo.

“Still pale….”, smirked Zaki.

Ace: Whatever happened to violence is not the answer?
Yule: Sometimes it is necessary for peace.
Ace: “Blood begets blood”
Yule: You see how this new government will oppress and enslave so many. We the Church must save them.
Ace: By a bombing that kills innocents?
Yule: By making a statement. Don’t be so high and mighty. You killed to survive, you kill on assignment.
Death by itself is not a punishment, but it is punishment for those around them. Your organization made children orphans.
Ace: And your so called church, enslaved orphans.
