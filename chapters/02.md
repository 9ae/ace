# 02: Though storm clouds mask our beloved sun (Vienna Teng - Lullaby)

Flashback to Ace and Yule
Yule tells Ace about how they threaten his family’s village and forced them to convert.
He was the chief’s son, and was kept as hostage to make sure that their clan allied with the church.
The church took him and a few other children, who’s parents were burnt as heretics. Erik was one of them.

Viva’s family fleeing from fic-italy. There carriage got raided by bandits, Ace was separated from Sicili and Lesbia. For several years, Viva lived alone in the mountains with the knives she took from the bandits to hunt. Every night she prayed for her sister and cousin. When she was 14, missionaries found her, when she tried to raid their camp. Yule reasoned with her that the right thing to do was join them. Today: Ace and Yule face off again, Yule now a crusader, with blood on his hands.

Ace: Whatever happened to violence is not the answer?
Yule: Sometimes it is necessary for peace.
Ace: “Blood begets blood”
Yule: You see how this new government will oppress and enslave so many. We the Church must save them.
Ace: By a bombing that kills innocents?
Yule: By making a statement. Don’t be so high and mighty. You killed to survive, you kill on assignment.
Death by itself is not a punishment, but it is punishment for those around them. Your organization made children orphans.
Ace: And your so called church, enslaved orphans.
